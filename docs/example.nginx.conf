    # CryptPad serves static assets over these two domains.
    # `main_domain` is what users will enter in their address bar.
    # Privileged computation such as key management is handled in this scope
    # UI content is loaded via the `sandbox_domain`.
    # "Content Security Policy" headers prevent content loaded via the sandbox
    # from accessing privileged information.
    # These variables must be different to take advantage of CryptPad's sandboxing techniques.

    # this will limit the amount of information accessible to attackers.

    # for these purposes allows you to move them to a separate machine at a later date
    # if you find that a single machine cannot handle all of your users.

    # If you do, they'll be added as exceptions to any rules which block connections to remote domains.
