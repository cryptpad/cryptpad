% \begin{abstract}
%    This document describes the implementation of the \ds{} program.
%    The original version of this program was developed by Frank
%    Mittelbach to accompany his \texttt{doc.sty} which enables literate
%    programming in \LaTeX\@. Denys Duchier rewrote it to run either
%    with \TeX\ or with \LaTeX, and to allow full boolean expressions in
%    conditional guards instead of just comma-separated lists.
%    Johannes Braams re-united the two implementations, documented and
%    debugged the code.
%
%    In September 1995 Marcin Woli\'nski changed many parts of the
%    program to make use of \TeX's ability to write to multiple files
%    at the same time to avoid re-reading sources.  The performance
%    improvement of version~2.3 came at a price of compatibility with
%    some more obscure operating systems which limit the number of
%    files a process can keep open. This was corrected in September
%    1996 by Mark Wooding and his changes were ``creatively merged''
%    by Marcin Woli\'nski who made at the same time changes in batch
%    files processing, handling of preambles and introduced ``verbatim
%    mode''. After all that, David Carlisle merged the new version into
%    the \LaTeX\ sources, and made a few other changes, principally
%    making \ds{} work under initex, and removing the need for
%    batch files to say \verb|\def\batchfile{...}|.
% \end{abstract}
%
% \section{Introduction}
%
% \subsection{Why the \ds{} program?} When Frank Mittelbach created
%    the \texttt{doc} package, he invented a way to combine \TeX\ code
%    and its documentation. From then on it was more or less possible
%    to do literate programming in \TeX.
%
%    This way of writing \TeX\ programs obviously has great
%    advantages, especially when the program becomes larger than a
%    couple of macros.  There is one drawback however, and that is
%    that such programs may take longer than expected to run because
%    \TeX\ is an interpreter and has to decide for each line of the
%    program file what it has to do with it. Therefore, \TeX\ programs
%    may be sped up by removing all comments from them.
%
%    By removing the comments from a \TeX\ program a new problem is
%    introduced. We now have two versions of the program and both of
%    them {\em have\/} to be maintained. Therefore it would be nice to
%    have a possibility to remove the comments automatically, instead
%    of doing it by hand. So we need a program to remove comments from
%    \TeX\ programs. This could be programmed in any high level
%    language, but maybe not everybody has the right compiler to
%    compile the program.  Everybody who wants to remove comments from
%    \TeX\ programs has \TeX\@.  Therefore the \ds{} program is
%    implemented entirely in \TeX.
%
% \subsection{Functions of the \ds{} program}
%
%    Having created the \ds{} program to remove comment lines from
%    \TeX\ programs\footnote{Note that only comment lines, that is
%    lines that start with a single \texttt{\%} character, are removed;
%    all other comments stay in the code.} it became feasible to do more
%    than just strip comments.\\ Wouldn't it be nice to have a way to
%    include parts of the code only when some condition is set true?
%    Wouldn't it be as nice to have the possibility to split the
%    source of a \TeX\ program into several smaller files and combine
%    them later into one `executable'?\\ Both these wishes have been
%    implemented in the \ds{} program.
%
% \section{How to use the \ds{} program}
%    A number of ways exist to use the \ds{} program:
%    \begin{enumerate}
% \item The usual way to use \ds{} is to write a \emph{batch file}
%        in such a way that it can be directly processed by \TeX{}.
%       The batch file should contain the commands described below for
%       controlling the \ds{} program.
%    This allows you to set up a distribution where you can instruct
%        the user to simply run
%      \begin{quote}
%        \texttt{TEX} \meta{batch file}
%      \end{quote}
%        to generate the executable versions of your files from the
%        distribution sources.
%        Most of the \LaTeX\  distribution is packaged this way.
%        To produce such a batch file include a statement in your
%         `batch file' that
%        instructs \TeX\ to read \texttt{docstrip.tex}.
%        The beginning of such a file would look like:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \input docstrip
%    ...
%\end{verbatim}
%    By convention the batch file should have extension |.ins|. But
%    these days \ds{} in fact work with any extension.
%
%    \item Alternatively you can instruct \TeX\ to read the file
%        \texttt{docstrip.tex} and to see what happens. \TeX\ will ask
%        you a few questions about the file you would like to be
%        processed. When you have answered these questions it does
%        its job and strips the comments from your \TeX\ code.
%    \end{enumerate}
%
% \section{Configuring \ds}
% \subsection{Selecting output directories}
% \changes{2.3e}{1996/09/19}{Added documentation}
%    Inspired by a desire to simplify reinstallations of \LaTeXe{} and
%    to support operating systems which have an upper limit on the
%    number of files allowed in a directory, \ds\ now allows
%    installation scripts to specify output directories for files it
%    creates. We suggest using TDS (\TeX\ directory structure) names
%    of directories relative to \texttt{texmf} here. However these
%    names should be thought of as a labels rather than actual names
%    of directories. They get translated to actual system-dependent
%    pathnames according to commands contained in a configuration file
%    named \texttt{docstrip.cfg}.
%
%    The configuration file is read by \ds{} just before it starts to
%    process any batch file commands.
%
%    If this file is not present \ds{} uses some default settings which
%    ensure that files are only written to the current directory.
%    However by use of this configuration file, a site maintainer can
%    `enable' features of \ds{} that allow files to be written to
%    alternative directories.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\usedir}
%    Using this macro package author can tell where a file should be
%    installed. All |\file|s generated in the scope of that
%    declaration are written to a directory specified by its one
%    argument. For example in \LaTeXe{} installation following
%    declarations are used:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \usedir{tex/latex/base}
%    \usedir{makeindex}
%\end{verbatim}
%    And standard packages use
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \usedir{tex/latex/tools}
%    \usedir{tex/latex/babel}
%\end{verbatim}
%    etc.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\showdirectory}
%    Used to display directory names in messages. If some label is not
%    defined it expands to |UNDEFINED (label is ...)| otherwise to a
%    directory name. It is probably a good idea for every installation
%    script to display at startup list of all directories that would
%    be used and asking user to confirm that.
%
%    The above macros are used by package/installation script
%    author. The following macros are used in a configuration file,
%    |docstrip.cfg|, by a system administrator to
%    describe her/his local directory structure.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\BaseDirectory} This macro is administrator's way of
%    saying ``yes, I want to use that directories support of
%    yours''. \ds{} will write only to current directory unless your
%    config has a call to this macro. (This means \ds{} won't write to
%    random directories unless you tell it to, which is nice.) Using
%    this macro you can specify a base directory for \TeX-related
%    stuff. E.g., for many Unix systems that would be
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \BaseDirectory{/usr/local/lib/texmf}
%\end{verbatim}
%    and for standard em\TeX{} installation
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \BaseDirectory{c:/emtex}
%\end{verbatim}
%
% \DescribeMacro{\DeclareDir}
%    Having specified the base directory you should tell \ds{} how to
%    interpret labels used in |\usedir| commands. This is done with
%    |\DeclareDir| with two arguments. The first is the label and the
%    second is actual name of directory relative to base
%    directory. For example to teach \ds{} using standard em\TeX{}
%    directories one would say:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \BaseDirectory{c:/emtex}
%    \DeclareDir{tex/latex/base}{texinput/latex2e}
%    \DeclareDir{tex/latex/tools}{texinput/tools}
%    \DeclareDir{makeindex}{idxstyle}
%\end{verbatim}
%    This will cause base latex files and font descriptions to be
%    written to directory |c:\emtex\texinput\latex2e|, files of the 
%    \texttt{tools} package to be written to |c:\emtex\texinput\tools| 
%    and makeindex files to |c:\emtex\idxstyle|.
%
%    Sometimes it is desirable to put some files outside of the base
%    directory. For that reason |\DeclareDir| has a star form
%    specifying absolute pathname. For example one could say
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \DeclareDir*{makeindex}{d:/tools/texindex/styles}
%\end{verbatim}
%
%    \DescribeMacro{\UseTDS}
%    Users of systems conforming to TDS may well ask here ``do I
%    really need to put a dozen of lines like
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \DeclareDir{tex/latex/base}{tex/latex/base}
%\end{verbatim}
%    in my config file''. The answer is |\UseTDS|. This macro causes
%    \ds{} to use labels themselves for any directory you haven't
%    overridden with |\DeclareDir|. The default behaviour is to raise
%    an error on undefined labels because some users may want to know
%    exactly where files go and not to allow \ds{} to write to random
%    places. However I (MW) think this is pretty cool and my
%    config says just (I'm running te\TeX{} under Linux)
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \BaseDirectory{/usr/local/teTeX/texmf}
%    \UseTDS
%\end{verbatim}
%
%    The important thing to note here is that it is impossible to create
%    a new directory from inside \TeX{}. So however you configure
%    \ds, you need to create all needed directories before running
%    the installation.  Authors may want to begin
%    every installation script by displaying a list of directories
%    that will be used and asking user if he's sure all of them
%    exist.
%
%    Since file name syntax is OS specific \ds{} tries to guess it
%    from the current directory syntax. It should succeed for Unix,
%    MSDOS, Macintosh and VMS. However \ds{} will only initially
%    know the current directory syntax if it is used with \LaTeX.
%    If used with plain\TeX\ or initex it will not have this
%    information\footnote{Except when processing the main
%    \texttt{unpack.ins} batch file for the \LaTeX\ distribution, which
%    takes special measures so that initex can learn the directory
%    syntax.}.
%    If you often use \ds{} with formats other than \LaTeX\ you should
%    \emph{start} the file |docstrip.cfg| with a definition of
%    |\WriteToDir|.  E.g.,
%   |\def\WriteToDir{./}| on MSDOS/Unix,
%   |\def\WriteToDir{:}| on Macintosh,
%   |\def\WriteToDir{[]}| on VMS.
%
%    If your system requires something
%    completely different you can define in |docstrip.cfg| macros
%    |\dirsep| and |\makepathname|. Check for their definition in the
%    implementation part. If you want some substantially different
%    scheme of translating |\usedir| labels into directory names try
%    redefining macro |\usedir|.
%
% \subsection{Setting maximum numbers of streams}
%
% \DescribeMacro{\maxfiles}
%    In support of some of the more obscure operating systems, there's
%    a limit on the number of files a program can have open.  This can
%    be expressed to \ds\ through the |\maxfiles| macro.  If the number
%    of streams \ds\ is allowed to open is $n$, your configuration file
%    can say |\maxfiles{|$n$|}|, and \ds\ won't try to open more files
%    than this.  Note that this limit won't include files which are
%    already open.  There'll usually be two of these: the installation
%    script which you started, and the file |docstrip.tex| which it
%    included; you must bear these in mind yourself.  \ds\ assumes
%    that it can open at least four files before it hits some kind of
%    maximum: if this isn't the case, you have real problems.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\maxoutfiles}
%    Maybe instead of having a limit on the number of files \TeX\ can
%    have open, there's a limit on the number of files it can write
%    to (e.g., \TeX\ itself imposes a limit of 16~files being written
%    at a time).  This can be expressed by saying |\maxoutfiles{|$m$|}|
%    in a configuration file.  You must be able to have at least one
%    output file open at a time; otherwise \ds\ can't do anything at
%    all.
%
%    Both these options would typically be put in the |docstrip.cfg|
%    file.
%
%
% \section{The user interface}
%
% \subsection{The main program}
% \DescribeMacro{\processbatchFile} The `main program' starts with
%    trying to process a batch file, this is accomplished by calling
%    the macro |\processbatchFile|. It counts the number of batch
%    files it processes, so that when the number of files processed is
%    still zero after the call to |\processbatchFile| appropriate
%    action can be taken.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\interactive} When no batch files have been processed
%    the macro |\interactive| is called. It prompts the user for
%    information. First the extensions of the input and output files
%    is determined. Then a question about optional code is asked and
%    finally the user can give a list of files that have to be
%    processed.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\ReportTotals} When the \texttt{stats} option is
%    included in the \ds{}-program it keeps a record of the number of
%    files and lines that are processed.  Also the number of comments
%    removed and passed as well as the number of code lines that were
%    passed to the output are accounted. The macro |\ReportTotals|
%    shows a summary of this information.
%
% \subsection{Batchfile commands}
%
%    The commands described in this section are available to build a
%    batch file for \TeX.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\input}
% All \ds{} batch files should start with the line: |\input docstrip|
%
% Do not use the  \LaTeX\ syntax |\input{docstrip}| as batch files may
% be used with plain~\TeX\ or ini\TeX.
% You may that old batch files always have a line
% |\def\batchfile{|\meta{filename}|}|
% just before the input.
% Such usage is still supported but is now discouraged, as it causes
% \TeX\ to re-input the same file, using up one of its limited number
% of input streams.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\endbatchfile}
% All batch files should end with this command. Any lines after this
% in the file are ignored. In old files that start
% |\def\batchfile{|\ldots\ this command is optional, but is a good
% idea anyway. If this command is omitted from a batchfile then
% normally \TeX\ will go to its interactive |*| prompt, so you may
% stop \ds{} by typing |\endbatchfile| to this prompt.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\generate}
% \DescribeMacro{\file}
% \DescribeMacro{\from}
%    The main reason for constructing a \ds{} command file is to
%    describe what files should be generated, from what sources and
%    what optional (`guarded') pieces of code should be included. The
%    macro |\generate| is used to give \TeX\ this information. Its
%    syntax is:
%    \begin{quote}
%    |\generate{|[|\file{|\meta{output}|}{|[|\from{|^^A
%                    \meta{input}|}{|\meta{optionlist}|}|]*|}|]*|}|
%    \end{quote}
%    The \meta{output} and \meta{input} are normal file specifications
%    as are appropriate for your computer system. The
%    \meta{optionlist} is a comma separated list of `options' that
%    specify which optional code fragments in \meta{input} should be
%    included in \meta{output}. Argument to |\generate| may contain
%    some local declarations (e.g., the |\use...| commands described
%    below) that will apply to all |\file|s after them. Argument to
%    |\generate| is executed inside a group, so all local declarations
%    are undone when |\generate| concludes.
%
%    It is possible to specify multiple input files, each with its own
%    \meta{optionlist}. This is indicated by the notation [\ldots]*.
%    Moreover there can be many |\file| specifications in one
%    |\generate| clause. This means that all these \meta{output} files
%    should be generated while reading each of \meta{input} files
%    once. Input files are read in order of first appearance in this
%    clause. E.g.
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \generate{\file{p1.sty}{\from{s1.dtx}{foo,bar}}
%              \file{p2.sty}{\from{s2.dtx}{baz}
%                            \from{s3.dtx}{baz}}
%              \file{p3.sty}{\from{s1.dtx}{zip}
%                            \from{s2.dtx}{zip}}
%             }
%\end{verbatim}
%    will cause \ds{} to read files \texttt{s1.dtx}, \texttt{s2.dtx},
%    \texttt{s3.dtx} (in that order) and produce files
%    \texttt{p1.sty}, \texttt{p2.sty}, \texttt{p3.sty}.
%
%    The restriction to at most 16 output streams open in a while
%     does not mean that you can produce at most 16 files with one
%    |\generate|. In the example above only 2 streams are needed,
%    since while \texttt{s1.dtx} is processed only \texttt{p1.sty} and
%    \texttt{p3.sty} are being generated; while reading
%    \texttt{s2.dtx} only \texttt{p2.sty} and \texttt{p3.sty}; and
%    while reading \texttt{s3.dtx} file \texttt{p2.sty} . However
%    example below needs 3 streams:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \generate{\file{p1.sty}{\from{s1.dtx}{foo,bar}}
%              \file{p2.sty}{\from{s2.dtx}{baz}
%                            \from{s3.dtx}{baz}}
%              \file{p3.sty}{\from{s1.dtx}{zip}
%                            \from{s3.dtx}{zip}}
%             }
%\end{verbatim}
%    Although while reading \texttt{s2.dtx} file \texttt{p3.sty} is
%    not written it must remain open since some parts of
%    \texttt{s3.dtx} will go to it later.
%
%    Sometimes it is not possible to create a file by reading  all
%    sources once. Consider the following example:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \generate{\file{p1.sty}{\from{s1.dtx}{head}
%                            \from{s2.dtx}{foo}
%                            \from{s1.dtx}{tail}}
%              \file{s1.drv}{\from{s1.dtx}{driver}}
%             }
%\end{verbatim}
%    To generate \texttt{p1.sty} file \texttt{s1.dtx} must be read
%    twice: first time with option \texttt{head}, then file
%    \texttt{s2.dtx} is read and then \texttt{s1.dtx} again this time
%    with option \texttt{tail}.  \ds{} handles this case correctly: if
%    inside one |\file| declaration there are multiple |\from|es with
%    the same input file this file \emph{is} read multiple times.
%
%    If the order of |\from|s specified in one of your |\file|
%    specifications does not match the order of input files
%    established by previous |\file|s, \ds{} will raise an error and
%    abort. Then you may either read one of next sections or give up
%    and put that file in separate |\generate| (but then sources will
%    be read again just for that file).
%
%    \paragraph{For impatient.} Try following algorithm: Find
%    file that is generated from largest number of sources, start
%    writing |\generate| clause with this file and its sources in
%    proper order. Take other files that are to be generated and add
%    them checking if they don't contradict order of sources for the
%    first one. If this doesn't work read next sections.
%
%    \paragraph{For mathematicians.} Relation ``file $A$ must  be
%    read before file $B$'' is a partial order on the set of all your
%    source files.  Each |\from| clause adds a chain to this order.
%    What you have to do is to perform a topological sort i.e. to
%    extend partial order to linear one.  When you have done it just
%    list your source files in |\generate| in such a way that order of
%    their first appearance in the clause matches linear order. If
%    this cannot be achieved read next paragraph. (Maybe future
%    versions of \ds{} will perform this sort automatically, so all
%    these troubles will disappear.)
%
%    \paragraph{For that who must know that all.} There  is  a
%    diverse case when it's not possible to achieve proper order of
%    reading source files. Suppose you have to generate two files,
%    first from \texttt{s1.dtx} and \texttt{s3.dtx} (in that order)
%    and second from \texttt{s2.dtx} and \texttt{s3.dtx}.  Whatever
%    way you specify this the files will be read in either as
%    \texttt{s1 s3 s2} or \texttt{s2 s3 s1}. The key to solution is
%    magical macro |\needed| that marks a file as needed to be input
%    but not directing any output from it to current |\file|. In our
%    example proper specification is:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \generate{\file{p1.sty}{\from{s1.dtx}{foo}
%                            \needed{s2.dtx}
%                            \from{s3.dtx}{bar}}
%              \file{p2.sty}{\from{s2.dtx}{zip}
%                            \from{s3.dtx}{zap}}
%             }
%\end{verbatim}
%
%
%  \DescribeMacro{\askforoverwritetrue}
%  \DescribeMacro{\askforoverwritefalse}
%    These macros specify what should happen if a file that is to be
%    generated already exists. If |\askforoverwritetrue| is active
%    (the default) the user is asked whether the file should be
%    overwritten. If however |\askforoverwritefalse| was issued
%    existing files will be overwritten silently.  These switches are
%    local and can be issued in any place in the file even inside
%    |\generate| clause (between |\file|s however).
%
%  \DescribeMacro{\askonceonly}
%  You might not want to set |\askforoverwritefalse| in a batch file
%  as that says that it us always all right to overwrite other people's
%  files. However for large installations, such as the base \LaTeX\
%  distribution,  being asked individually about hundreds of files
%  is not very helpful either. A batchfile may therefore specify
%  |\askonceonly|. This means that after the first time the batchfile
%  asks the user a question, the user is given an option of to change
%  the behaviour so that `yes' will be automatically assumed for all
%  future questions. This applies to any use of the \ds{} command
%  |\Ask| including, but not restricted to, the file overwrite
%  questions controlled by |\askforoverwritetrue|.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\preamble}
% \DescribeMacro{\endpreamble}
% \DescribeMacro{\postamble}
% \DescribeMacro{\endpostamble}
%    It is possible to add a number of lines to the output of the
%    \ds{} program. The information you want to add to the start of
%    the output file should be listed between the |\preamble| and
%    |\endpreamble| commands; the lines you want to add to the end of
%    the output file should be listed between the |\postamble| and
%    |\endpostamble| commands. Everything that \ds{} finds for both
%    the pre- and postamble it writes to the output file, but preceded
%    with value of |\MetaPrefix| (default is two \%-characters). If
%    you include a |^^J| character in one of these lines, everything
%    that follows it on the same line is written to a new line in the
%    output file.  This `feature' can be used to add a |\typeout| or
%    |\message| to the stripped file.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\declarepreamble}
% \DescribeMacro{\declarepostamble}
% \DescribeMacro{\usepreamble}
% \DescribeMacro{\usepostamble}
% \DescribeMacro{\nopreamble}
% \DescribeMacro{\nopostamble}
%    Sometimes it is desirable to have different preambles for different
%    files  of  a  larger  package  (e.g.,  because  some  of them are
%    customisable  configuration  files and they should be marked as
%    such). In such a case one can say |\declarepreamble\somename|,
%    then type in his/her preamble, end it with |\endpreamble|,
%    and  later  on  |\usepreamble\somename|  to  switch   to   this
%    preamble.
%    If no preamble  should be used you can deploy the |\nopreamble|
%    command. This command is equivalent to saying  |\usepreamble\empty|.
%    The  same  mechanism works for postambles, |\use...|
%    declarations are local and can appear inside |\generate|.
%
%    Commands   |\preamble|   and   |\postamble| define and  activate
%    pre(post)ambles named |\defaultpreamble| and |\defaultpostamble|.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\batchinput}
%    The batch file commands can be put into several batch files which
%    are then executed from a master batch file. This is, for example,
%    useful if a distribution consists of several distinct parts. You
%    can then write individual batch files for every part and in
%    addition a master file that simply calls the batch files for the
%    parts.  For this, call the individual batch files from the master
%    file with the command |\batchinput{|\meta{file}|}|. Don't use
%    |\input| for this purpose, this command
%    should be used only for calling the \ds{} program as explained
%    above and is ignored when used for any other purpose.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\ifToplevel}
%    When batch files are nested you may want to suppress certain
%    commands in the lower-level batch files such as terminal
%    messages. For this purpose you can use the |\ifToplevel| command
%    which executes its argument only if the current batch file is the
%    outermost one. Make sure that you put the opening brace of the
%    argument into the same line as the command itself, otherwise the
%    \ds{} program will get confused.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\showprogress}
% \DescribeMacro{\keepsilent}
%    When the option \texttt{stats} is included in \ds{} it can
%    write message to the terminal as each line of the input file(s) is
%    processed. This message consists of a single character, indicating
%    kind of that particular line. We use the
%    following characters:
%    \begin{itemize}
% \item[\texttt{\%}] Whenever an input line is a comment
%        \texttt{\%}-character is written to the terminal.
% \item[\texttt{.}] Whenever a code line is encountered
%        a \texttt{.}-character is written on the terminal.
% \item[\texttt{/}] When a number of empty lines appear in a row in the
%        input file, at most one of them is retained. The \ds{}
%        program signals the removal of an empty line with the
%        \texttt{/}-character.
% \item[\texttt{<}] When a `guard line' is found in the input and it
%        starts a block of optionally included code, this is signalled
%        on the terminal by showing the \texttt{<}-character, together
%        with the boolean expression of the guard.
% \item[\texttt{>}] The end of a conditionally included block of code is
%        indicated by showing the \texttt{>}-character.
%    \end{itemize}
%    This feature is turned on by default when the option
%    \texttt{stats} is included, otherwise it is turned off. The
%    feature can be toggled with the commands |\showprogress| and
%    |\keepsilent|.
%
%
%  \subsubsection{Supporting old interface}
%
% \DescribeMacro{\generateFile}
%    Here is the old syntax for specifying  what  files  are  to  be
%    generated. It allows specification of just one output file.
%    \begin{quote}
%    |\generateFile{|\meta{output}|}{|\meta{ask}|}{|[|\from{|^^A
%                    \meta{input}|}{|\meta{optionlist}|}|]*|}|
%    \end{quote}
%    The meaning of \meta{output}, \meta{input} and
%    \meta{optionslist} is just as for |\generate|.  With
%    \meta{ask} you can instruct \TeX\ to either silently overwrite a
%    previously existing file (|f|) or to issue a warning and ask you
%    if it should overwrite the existing file (|t|) (it overrides the
%    |\askforoverwrite| setting).
%
% \DescribeMacro{\include}
% \DescribeMacro{\processFile}
%    The earlier version of the \ds{} program supported a
%    different kind of command to tell \TeX\ what to do. This command
%    is less powerful than |\generateFile|; it can be used when
%    \meta{output} is created from one \meta{input}. The syntax is:
%    \begin{quote}
%    |\include{|\meta{optionlist}|}|
%
%    |\processFile{|\meta{name}|}{|\meta{inext}^^A
%                              |}{|\meta{outext}^^A
%                              |}{|\meta{ask}|}|
%    \end{quote}
%    This command is based on environments where filenames are
%    constructed of two parts, the name and the extension, separated
%    with a dot. The syntax of this command assumes that the
%    \meta{input} and \meta{output} share the same name and only
%    differ in their extension. This command is retained to be
%    backwards compatible with the older version of \ds{}, but its use
%    is not encouraged.
%
% \section{Conditional inclusion of code}
%
%    When you use the \ds{} program to strip comments out of
%    \TeX\ macro files you have the possibility to make more than one
%    stripped macro file from one documented file. This is achieved by
%    the support for optional code. The optional code is marked
%    in the documented file with a `guard'.
%
%    A guard is a boolean expression that is enclosed in |<| and |>|.
%    It also {\em has\/} to follow the |%| at the beginning of the line.
%    For example:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    ...
%    %<bool>\TeX code
%    ...
%\end{verbatim}
%    In this example the line of code will be included in \meta{output}
%    if the option \texttt{bool} is present in the \meta{optionlist} of
%    the |\generateFile| command.
%
%    The syntax for the boolean expressions is:
%
%\DeleteShortVerb\|
%    \begin{tabular}{lcl}
%    \meta{Expression} & $::=$ & \meta{Secondary}
%                            [\{\texttt{|}, \texttt{,}\}
%                            \meta{Secondary}]*\\
%    \meta{Secondary}    & $::=$ &
%                        \meta{Primary} [\texttt{\&}
%                         \meta{Primary}]*\\
%    \meta{Primary}  & $::=$ &
%                        \meta{Terminal} $|$ \texttt{!}\meta{Primary}
%                        $|$ \texttt{(}\meta{Expression}\texttt{)}\\
%    \end{tabular}
%
%    The \texttt{|} stands for disjunction, the \texttt{\&} stands for
%    conjunction and the \texttt{!}\ stands for negation. The
%    \meta{Terminal} is any sequence of letters and evaluates to
%    \meta{true} iff\footnote{iff stands for `if and only if'} it
%    occurs in the list of options that have to be included.
%\MakeShortVerb\|
%
%    Two kinds of optional code are supported: one can either have
%    optional code that `fits' on one line of text, like the example
%    above, or one can have blocks of optional code.
%
%    To distinguish both kinds of optional code the `guard modifier'
%    has been introduced. The `guard modifier' is one character that
%    immediately follows the |<| of the guard. It can be either |*|
%    for the beginning of a block of code, or |/| for the end of a
%    block of code\footnote{To be compatible with the earlier version
%    of \ds{} also \texttt{+} and \texttt{-} are supported as `guard
%    modifiers'.  However, there is an incompatibility with the
%    earlier version since a line with a \texttt{+}-modified guard is
%    not included inside a block with a guard that evaluates to false,
%    in contrast to the previous behaviour.}.  The beginning and
%    ending guards for a block of code have to be on a line by
%    themselves.
%
%    When a block of code is {\em not\/} included, any guards that occur
%    within that block are {\em not\/} evaluated.
%
% \section{Those other languages}
%    Since \TeX\ is an open system some of \TeX\ packages include
%    non-\TeX\ files. Some authors use \ds\ to generate PostScript
%    headers, shell scripts or programs in other languages. For them
%    the comments-stripping activity of \ds\ may cause some
%    trouble. This section describes how to produce non-\TeX\ files
%    with \ds\ effectively.
%
% \subsection{Stuff \ds\ puts in every file}
%    First problem when producing files in ``other'' languages is that
%    \ds\ adds some bits to the beginning and end of every generated
%    file that may not fit with the syntax of the language in
%    question. So we'll study carefully what exactly goes where.
%
%    The whole text put on beginning of file is kept in a macro defined
%    by |\declarepreamble|. Every line of input presented to
%    |\declarepreamble| is prepended with current value of
%    |\MetaPrefix|. Standard \ds\ header is inserted before your text,
%    and macros |\inFileName|, |\outFileName| and |\ReferenceLines|
%    are used as placeholders for information which will be filled in
%    later (specifically for each output file). Don't try to redefine
%    these macros. After
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \declarepreamble\foo
%    ____________________________
%    Package FOO for use with TeX
%    \endpreamble
%\end{verbatim}
%    macro |\foo| is defined as
%\begin{verbatim}
%    %%^^J
%    %% This is file `\outFileName ',^^J
%    %% generated with the docstrip utility.^^J
%    \ReferenceLines^^J
%    %% ____________________________^^J
%    %% Package FOO for use with TeX.
%\end{verbatim}
%    You can play with it freely or even define it from scratch. To
%    embed the preamble in Adobe structured comments just use |\edef|:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \edef\foo{\perCent!PS-Adobe-3.0^^J%
%              \DoubleperCent\space Title: \outFileName^^J%
%              \foo^^J%
%              \DoubleperCent\space EndComments}
%\end{verbatim}
%    After that use |\usepreamble\foo| to select your new preamble.
%    Everything above works as well for postambles.
%
%    You may also prevent \ds\ from adding anything to your file, and
%    put any language specific invocations directly in your code:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \generate{\usepreamble\empty
%              \usepostamble\empty
%              \file{foo.ps}{\from{mypackage.dtx}{ps}}}
%\end{verbatim}
%    or alternatively |\nopreamble| and |\nopostamble|.
%
% \subsection{Meta comments}
%    You can change the prefix used for putting meta comments to
%    output files by redefining |\MetaPrefix|. Its default value is
%    |\DoubleperCent|. The preamble uses value of |\MetaPrefix|
%    current at time of |\declarepreamble| while meta comments in the
%    source file use value current at time of |\generate|. Note that
%    this means that you cannot produce concurrently two files using
%    different |\MetaPrefix|es.
%
% \subsection{Verbatim mode}
%    If your programming language uses some construct that can
%    interferes badly with \ds\ (e.g., percent in column one) you may
%    need a way for preventing it from being stripped off. For that
%    purpose \ds\ features `verbatim mode'.
%
%    A `Guard expression' of the form |%<<|\meta{END-TAG} marks
%    the start of a section that will be copied verbatim upto a line
%    containing only a percent in column 1 followed by \meta{END-TAG}.
%    You can select any \meta{END-TAG} you want, but note that spaces
%     count here. Example:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    %<*myblock>
%    some stupid()
%       #computer<program>
%    %<<COMMENT
%    % These two lines are copied verbatim (including percents
%    %% even if \MetaPrefix is something different than %%).
%    %COMMENT
%       using*strange@programming<language>
%    %</myblock>
%\end{verbatim}
%    And the output is (when stripped with \texttt{myblock} defined):
%\begin{verbatim}
%    some stupid()
%       #computer<program>
%    % These two lines are copied verbatim (including percents
%    %% even if \MetaPrefix is something different than %%).
%       using*strange@programming<language>
%\end{verbatim}

% \section{Producing the documentation}
%
%    We provide a short driver file that can be extracted by the
%    \ds{} program using the conditional `\textsf{driver}'.  To
%    allow the use of \texttt{docstrip.dtx} as a program at Ini\TeX{}
%    time (e.g., to strip
%    off its own comments) we need to add a bit of primitive code.
%    With this extra checking it is still possible to process this
%    file with \LaTeXe{} to typeset the documentation.
% \changes{2.1b}{1993/02/23}{Added fontdefinitions for doc to the driver
%                          file, in order to get the layout of the code
%                          right; also added the layout definitions
%                          that are in effect in \texttt{doc.drv}}
% \changes{2.1c}{1993/02/23}{Remove definitions for fonts again}
% \changes{2.2f}{1994/02/26}{Allow direct processing of source}
%    \begin{macrocode}
%<*driver>
%    \end{macrocode}
%    If |\documentclass| is undefined, e.g., if Ini\TeX{} or plain
%    \TeX{} is used for formatting, we bypass the driver file.
%
% \changes{2.3a}{1995/08/20}{Changed driver}
%    We use some trickery to avoid issuing |\end{document}| when
%    the |\ifx| construction is unfinished. If condition below is
%    true a |\fi| is constructed on the fly, the |\ifx| is completed,
%    and the real |\fi| will never be seen as it comes after
%    |\end{document}|. On the other hand if condition is false
%    \TeX\ skips over |\csname fi\endcsname| having no idea that
%    this could stand for |\fi|, driver is skipped and only then
%    the condition completed.
%
%    Additional guard |gobble| prevents \ds\ from extracting
%    these tricks to real driver file.
%    \begin{macrocode}
%<*gobble>
\ifx\jobname\relax\let\documentclass\undefined\fi
\ifx\documentclass\undefined
\else \csname fi\endcsname
%</gobble>
%    \end{macrocode}
%    Otherwise we process the following lines which will result in
%    formatting the documentation.

% \changes{2.0n}{1992/04/26}{Added macro}
% \changes{2.1a}{1993/02/22}{Completely redefined (so that it works)}
%
%    When the file \texttt{docstrip.tex} is read because of an
%    |\input| statement in a batch file we have to prevent an
%    endless loop (well, limited by \TeX's stack). Therefore we save
%    the original primitive |\input| and define a new macro with
%    an argument delimited by \verb*= = (i.e.\ a space) that just
%    gobbles the argument.  Since the end-of-line character is
%    converted by \TeX{} to a space.  This means that |\input| is not
%    available as a command within batch files.
%
% \begin{macro}{\@@input}
% \changes{2.1a}{1993/02/22}{Macro added}
%    We therefore keep a copy of the original under the name
%    |\@@input| for internal use. If \ds{} runs under \LaTeX{} this
%    command is already defined, so we make a quick test.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\ifx\undefined\@@input \let\@@input\input\fi
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
%
%    To allow the nesting of batch files the |\batchinput| command is
%    provided it takes one argument, the name of the batch file to
%    switch to.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\batchinput#1{%
%    \end{macrocode}
%    We start a new group and locally redefine |\batchFile| to hold
%    the new batch file name. We toggle the |\iftopbatchfile| switch
%    since this definitely is not top batch file.
%    \begin{macrocode}
   \begingroup
     \def\batchfile{#1}%
     \topbatchfilefalse
     \Defaultfalse
     \usepreamble\org@preamble
     \usepostamble\org@postamble
     \let\destdir\WriteToDir
%    \end{macrocode}
%    After this we can simply call |\processbatchFile| which will
%    open the new batch file and read it until it
%    is exhausted. Note that if the batch file is not available, or
%    misspelled this routine will produce a warning and return.
%    \begin{macrocode}
     \processbatchFile
%    \end{macrocode}
%    The value of |\batchfile| as well as local definitions of

% \begin{macro}{\guardStack}
%    \changes{2.0k}{1992/04/06}{Renamed from \texttt{\bsl blockStack}}
%    Because blocks of code that will conditionally be included in the
%    output can be nested, a stack is maintained to keep track of
%    these blocks. The main reason for this is that we want to be able
%    to check if the blocks are properly nested. The stack itself is

%    \begin{macrocode}

%    |\DoubleperCent|. The macro |\MetaPrefix| is put on beginning of
%    every meta-comment line. It is defined indirect way since some
%    applications need redefining it.
%    \begin{macrocode}

%    \begin{macrocode}

%    \end{macrocode}
%
%    The only result of using |\Name| is slowing down execution since
%    its typical use (e.g., |\Name\def{foo bar}...|) has exactly the
%    same number of tokens as its expansion. However I think that it's
%    easier to read. The meaning of |\Name| as a black box is:
%    ``construct a name from second parameter and then pass it to your
%    first parameter as a parameter''.
%
%    |\@stripstring| is used to get tokens building name of a macro
%    without leading backslash.

%    sequence.  For these purposes the control sequence |\tmp| is
%    used.
% \end{macro}
%
% \subsection{Support macros}
%    \subsubsection{The stack mechanism}
%
%    It is possible to have `nested guards'. This means that within a
%    block of optionally included code a subgroup is only included
%    when an additional option is specified. To keep track of the
%    nesting of the guards the currently `open' guard can be pushed on
%    the stack |\guardStack| and later popped off the stack again. The
%    macros that implement this stack mechanism are loosely based on
%    code that is developed in the context of the \LaTeX3 project.
%
%    To be able to implement a stack mechanism we need a couple of
%    support macros.
% \begin{macro}{\eltStart}
%    \changes{2.0k}{1992/04/06}{Macro added}
% \begin{macro}{\eltEnd}
%    \changes{2.0k}{1992/04/06}{Macro added}
%    The macros |\eltStart| and |\eltEnd| are used to delimit a stack
%    element. They are both empty.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\eltStart{}
\def\eltEnd{}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \end{macro}
%
% \begin{macro}{\qStop}
%    \changes{2.0k}{1992/04/06}{Macro added}
%    The macro |\qStop| is a so-called `quark', a macro that expands to
%    itself\footnote{The concept of `quarks' is developed for the
%    \LaTeX3 project.}.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\qStop{\qStop}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
%
% \begin{macro}{\pop}
%    \changes{2.0k}{1992/04/06}{Macro added} The macro
%    |\pop|\meta{stack}\meta{cs} `pops' the top element from the
%    stack. It assigns the value of the top element to \meta{cs} and
%    removes it from \meta{stack}. When \meta{stack} is empty a
%    warning is issued and \meta{cs} is assigned an empty value.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\pop#1#2{%
  \ifx#1\empty
    \Msg{Warning: Found end guard without matching begin}%
    \let#2\empty
  \else
%    \end{macrocode}
%    To be able to `peel' off the first guard we use an extra macro
%    |\popX| that receives both the expanded and the unexpanded stack
%    in its arguments. The expanded stack is delimited with the quark
%    |\qStop|.
%    \begin{macrocode}
    \def\tmp{\expandafter\popX #1\qStop #1#2}%
    \expandafter\tmp\fi}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \begin{macro}{\popX}
%    \changes{2.0k}{1992/04/06}{Macro added} When the stack is expanded
%    the elements are surrounded with |\eltStart| and |\eltEnd|. The
%    first element of the stack is assigned to |#4|.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\popX\eltStart #1\eltEnd #2\qStop #3#4{\def#3{#2}\def#4{#1}}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \end{macro}
%
% \begin{macro}{\push}
%    \changes{2.0k}{1992/04/06}{Macro added}
%    Guards can be pushed on the stack using the macro
%    |\push|\meta{stack}\meta{guard}. Again we need a secondary macro
%    (|\pushX|) that has both the expanded and the unexpanded stack as
%    arguments.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\push#1#2{\expandafter\pushX #1\qStop #1{\eltStart #2\eltEnd}}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \begin{macro}{\pushX}
%    \changes{2.0k}{1992/04/06}{Macro added}
%    The macro |\pushX| picks up the complete expansion of the stack as
%    its first argument and places the guard in |#3| on the `top'.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\pushX #1\qStop #2#3{\def #2{#3#1}}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \end{macro}
%
% \subsubsection{Programming structures}
%
% \begin{macro}{\forlist}
% \changes{2.0g}{1991/06/05}{Macro added.}
%    When the program is used in interactive mode the
%    user can supply a list of files that have to be processed.
%    In order to process this list a for-loop is needed. This
%    implementation of such a programming construct is based on the
%    use of the \verb=\loop{=\meta{body}\verb=}\repeat= macro that
%    is defined in plain \TeX\@. The syntax for this loop is:
%    \begin{flushleft}
%    |\for|\meta{control sequence} |:=| \meta{list}
%    |\do|\\
%    \meta{body}\\
%    |\od|
%    \end{flushleft}
%    The \meta{list} should be a comma separated list.
%
%    The first actions that have to be taken are to set the switch
%    |\ifForlist| to \meta{true} and to store the loop condition
%    in the macro |\ListCondition|. This is done using an
%    |\edef| to allow for a control sequence that contains a
%    \meta{list}.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\forlist#1:=#2\do#3\od{%
    \edef\ListCondition{#2}%
    \Forlisttrue
%    \end{macrocode}
%    Then we start the loop.
%    We store the first element from the |\ListCondition| in the
%    macro that was supplied as the first argument to |\forlist|.
%    This element is then removed from the |\ListCondition|.
%    \begin{macrocode}
    \loop
      \edef#1{\expandafter\FirstElt\ListCondition,\empty.}%
      \edef\ListCondition{\expandafter\OtherElts\ListCondition,\empty.}%
%    \end{macrocode}
%    When the first element from the \meta{list} is empty, we are done
%    processing, so we switch |\ifForlist| to \meta{false}.
%    When it is not empty we execute the third argument that should
%    contain \TeX\ commands to execute.
%    \begin{macrocode}
      \ifx#1\empty \Forlistfalse \else#3\fi
%    \end{macrocode}
%    Finally we test the switch |\ifForlist| to decide whether the
%    loop has to be continued.
%    \begin{macrocode}
      \ifForlist
    \repeat}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \begin{macro}{\FirstElt}
% \changes{2.0g}{1991/06/05}{Macro added.}
%    The macro |\FirstElt| is used to get the first element from a
%    comma-separated list.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\FirstElt#1,#2.{#1}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \begin{macro}{\OtherElts}
% \changes{2.0g}{1991/06/05}{Macro added.}
%    The macro |\OtherElts| is used to get all elements {\em but\/}
%    the first element from a comma-separated list.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\OtherElts#1,#2.{#2}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \end{macro}
%
% \begin{macro}{\whileswitch}
% \changes{2.0h}{1991/06/19}{Macro added.} When the program is used in
%    interactive mode the user might want to process several files
%    with different options or extensions.  This goal could be reached
%    by running the program several times, but it is more
%    user-friendly to ask if he would like to process more files when
%    we are done processing his last request.  To accomplish this we
%    need the implementation of a \texttt{while}-loop.  Again plain
%    \TeX's \verb=\loop{=\meta{body}\verb=}\repeat= is used to
%    implement this programming structure.
%

% \subsection{The evaluation of boolean expressions}
%
%    For clarity we repeat here the syntax for the boolean expressions
%    in a somewhat changed but equivalent way:
%
% \DeleteShortVerb\|
%    \begin{tabular}{lcl}
%    \meta{Expression} & $::=$ & \meta{Secondary} $|$
%                            \meta{Secondary} \{\texttt{|}, \texttt{,}\}
%                              \meta{Expression}\\
%    \meta{Secondary}    & $::=$ & \meta{Primary} $|$
%                         \meta{Primary} \texttt{\&}
%                              \meta{Secondary}\\
%    \meta{Primary}  & $::=$ &
%                         \meta{Terminal} $|$ \texttt{!}\meta{Primary}
%                                  $|$
%                         \texttt{(}\meta{Expression}\texttt{)}\\
%    \end{tabular}
%
%    The \texttt{|} stands for disjunction, the \texttt{\&} stands for
%    conjunction and the \texttt{!}\ stands for negation. The
%    \meta{Terminal} is any sequence of letters and evaluates to
%    \meta{true} iff it occurs in the list of options that have to be
%    included.
% \MakeShortVerb\|
%
%    Since we can generate multiple output files  from  one  input,
%    same  guard  expressions  can  be  computed several times with
%    different options. For that reason we  first  ``compile''  the
%    expression   to  the  form  of  one  parameter  macro  |\Expr|
%    expanding to nested |\if|s that when  given  current  list  of
%    options  produces  1  or  0  as  a  result. The idea is to say
%    |\if1\Expr{|\meta{current set  of  options}|}...\fi|  for  all
%    output files.
%
%    Here is a table recursively defining  translations  for  right
%    sides  of the grammar. $\tau(X)$ denotes translation of~$X$.
%

%    \end{eqnarray*}
%    \endgroup
% \DeleteShortVerb\"
% \MakeShortVerb\|
%    |\t@<Terminal>|  denotes macro with name constructed from |t@|
%    with appended tokens of terminal. E.g., for terminal |foo|  the
%    translation would be
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \t@foo,#1,foo,\qStop
%\end{verbatim}
%    This will  end up in definition of |\Expr|,  so |#1| here will
%    be substituted by current list  of  options  when  |\Expr|  is
%    called. Macro |\t@foo| would be defined as
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \def\t@foo#1,foo,#2\qStop{\ifx>#2>0\else1\fi}
%\end{verbatim}
%    When  called  as  above  this  will  expand to |1| if |foo| is
%    present on current list of options and to |0| otherwise.
%
%    Macros  below  work  in  ``almost  expand-only''   mode   i.e.
%    expression is analyzed only by expansion but we have to define
%    some macros on the way (e.g., |\Expr| and |\t@foo|).
%
%    The   first   parameter   of   each   of   these   macros   is
%    ``continuation''   (in  the  sense  similar  to  the  language
%    \textsc{Scheme}). Continuation is a function of at  least  one
%    argument  (parameter)  being  the  value  of previous steps of
%    computation.   For   example   macro   |\Primary|   constructs
%    translation of \meta{Primary} expression. When it decides that
%    expression is completed it calls its continuation  (its  first
%    argument)   passing   to  it  whole  constructed  translation.
%    Continuation may expect more arguments if it wants to see what
%    comes next on the input.
%
%    We  will perform recursive descent parse, but definitions will
%    be presented in bottom-up order.
%
% \begin{macro}{\Terminal}
%
%    \meta{Terminal}s are  recognized  by  macro  |\Terminal|.  The
%    proper   way   of   calling  it  is  |\Terminal{|\meta{current
%    continuation}|}{}|.     Parameters     are:      continuation,
%    \meta{Terminal}  so  far  and  next  character from the input.
%    Macro checks if |#3| is one of terminal-ending characters  and
%    then  takes  appropriate  actions.  Since  there  are 7 ending
%    chars  and probably one |\csname| costs  less  than  7  nested
%    |\if|s we construct a name and check if it is defined.
%
%    We must expand |\ifx| completely before taking next actions so
%    we use |\afterfi|.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\Terminal#1#2#3{%
  \expandafter\ifx\csname eT@#3\endcsname\relax
%    \end{macrocode}
%    If condition is true |#3| belongs to  current  \meta{Terminal}
%    so we append it to \meta{Terminal}-so-far and call |\Terminal|
%    again.
%    \begin{macrocode}
    \afterfi{\Terminal{#1}{#2#3}}\else
%    \end{macrocode}
%    When condition is false it's time to end  the  \meta{Terminal}
%    so we call macro |\TerminalX|. Next character is reinserted to
%    the input.
%
%    In both cases continuation is passed unchanged.
%    \begin{macrocode}
    \afterfi{\TerminalX{#1}{#2}#3}\fi
  }
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
%
% \begin{macro}{\eT@}
%    Here we define macros marking characters  that  cannot  appear
%    inside  terminal.  The value is not important as long as it is
%    different from |\relax|.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\Name\let{eT@>}=1
\Name\let{eT@&}=1 \Name\let{eT@!}=1
\Name\let{eT@|}=1 \Name\let{eT@,}=1
\Name\let{eT@(}=1 \Name\let{eT@)}=1
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
%
% \begin{macro}{\TerminalX}
%    This macro should end scanning of \meta{Terminal}.  Parameters
%    are continuation and gathered tokens of \meta{Terminal}.
%
%    Macro starts by issuing an error message if \meta{Terminal} is
%    empty.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\TerminalX#1#2{%
  \ifx>#2> \errmessage{Error in expression: empty terminal}\fi
%    \end{macrocode}
%    Then  a  macro  is  constructed  for  checking   presence   of
%    \meta{Terminal} in options list.
%    \begin{macrocode}
  \Name\def{t@#2}##1,#2,##2\qStop{\ifx>##2>0\else1\fi}%
%    \end{macrocode}
%    And  then  current  continuation is called with translation of
%    \meta{Terminal} according to formula
%    $$\tau(\meta{Terminal})=|\t@<Terminal>,#1,<Terminal>,\qStop|$$
%    \begin{macrocode}
  #1{\Name\noexpand{t@#2},##1,#2,\noexpand\qStop}%
  }
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
%
% \begin{macro}{\Primary}
%    Parameters are continuation and next character from the input.
%
%    According to the syntax \meta{Primari}es can have three forms.
%    This  makes us use even more dirty tricks than usual. Note the
%    |\space| after a series of |\ifx|s. This  series  produces  an
%    one  digit  number of case to be executed. The number is given
%    to  |\ifcase|  and  |\space|  stops  \TeX{}  scanning  for   a
%    \meta{number}.  Use of |\ifcase| gives possibility to have one
%    of three actions  selected  without  placing  them  in  nested
%    |\if|s and so to use |\afterfi|.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\Primary#1#2{%
  \ifcase \ifx!#20\else\ifx(#21\else2\fi\fi\space
%    \end{macrocode}
%    First case is for |!| i.e.  negated \meta{Primary}.   In  this
%    case   we  call  |\Primary|  recursively  but  we  create  new
%    continuation:   macro  |\NPrimary|  that  will  negate  result
%    passed  by  |\Primary|  and  pass  it  to current continuation
%    (|#1|).
%    \begin{macrocode}
  \afterfi{\Primary{\NPrimary{#1}}}\or
%    \end{macrocode}
%    When next character is |(| we call |\Expression| giving it  as
%    continuation  macro  |\PExpression|  which  will just pass the
%    result up but ensuring first that a |)| comes next.
%    \begin{macrocode}
  \afterfi{\Expression{\PExpression{#1}}}\or
%    \end{macrocode}
%    Otherwise we start a \meta{Terminal}. |#2| is  not  passed  as
%    \meta{Terminal}-so-far  but reinserted to input since we didn't
%    check if it can appear in a \meta{Terminal}.
%    \begin{macrocode}
  \afterfi{\Terminal{#1}{}#2}\fi
  }
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
%
% \begin{macro}{\NPrimary}

% \changes{2.3a}{1995/08/20}{Trying to avoid assignments}
%    Each line that is read from the input stream has to be processed
%    to see if it has to be written on the output stream. This task
%    is performed by calling the macro |\processLine|.
%    In order to do
%    that, it needs to check whether the line starts with a
%    `\texttt{\%}'.  Therefore the macro is globally defined within a
%    group. Within this group the category code of `\texttt{\%}' is
%    changed to 12 (other).  Because a comment character is needed,
%    the category code of `\texttt{*}' is changed to 14 (comment
%    character).
%
%    The macro increments counter |\processedLines| by $1$ if
%    statistics are included. We cannot include this line with
%    |%<*stats>| since the category of \texttt{\%} is changed and the
%    file must be loadable unstripped. So the whole definition is
%    repeated embedded in guards.
%
%    The next token from the input stream is passed in |#1|. If it is
%    a `\texttt{\%}' further processing has to be done by
%    |\processLineX|; otherwise this is normal (not commented out)
%    line.
%
%    In either case the character read is reinserted to the input
%    as it may have to be written out.

%    `\texttt{\%}', a \meta{MetaComment} has been found. This has to

%    The processing of such an expression is started by calling

%
%    When the token was neither a `\texttt{\%}' nor a `\texttt{<}',

%    list of elements having some properties. For every input file

%    When a batch file is used the
%    user can specify a preamble of his own that will be written to
%    each file that is created. This can be useful to include an extra
%    copyright notice in the stripped version of a file.  Also a
%    warning that both versions of a file should {\em always\/} be

%
%    Every line that is written to |\outFile| that belongs to the
%    preamble is preceded by two percent characters. This will prevent
%    \ds{} from stripping these lines off the file.
%
%    The preamble should be started with the macro
%    |\declarepreamble|; it is ended by |\endpreamble|. All
