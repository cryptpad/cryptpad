% \section{Introduction}
%
% This package allows the user to specify an input encoding (for
% example, ASCII, ISO Latin-1 or Macintosh) by saying:
% \begin{quote}
%    |\usepackage[|\emph{encoding name}|]{inputenc}|
% \end{quote}
% The encoding can also be selected in the document with:
% \begin{quote}
%    |\inputencoding{|\emph{encoding name}|}|
% \end{quote}
%    Originally this command was only to be used in vertical mode (with
%    the idea that it should be only  within a document when
%    using text from several documents to build up a composite work such
%    as a volume of journal articles.  However, usages in certain
%    languages suggested that it might be preferable to allow changing
%    the input encoding at any time, which is what is possible now
%    (though that is quite computing resource intensive).
%
% The encodings provided by this package are:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item |ascii| ASCII encoding for the range 32--127 (all others are made
%        invalid, i.e., this really defines a 7-bit encoding).
% \item |latin1| ISO Latin-1 encoding.
% \item |latin2| ISO Latin-2 encoding.
% \item |latin3| ISO Latin-3 encoding.
% \item |latin4| ISO Latin-4 encoding.
% \item |latin5| ISO Latin-5 encoding.
% \item |latin9| ISO Latin-9 encoding.
% \item |latin10| ISO Latin-10 encoding.
% \item |decmulti| DEC Multinational Character Set encoding.
% \item |cp850| IBM 850 code page.
% \item |cp852| IBM 852 code page.
% \item |cp858| IBM 858 code page (this is 850 with Euro symbol).
% \item |cp437| IBM 437 code page.
% \item |cp437de| IBM 437 code page (German version).
% \item |cp865| IBM 865 code page.
% \item |applemac| Macintosh encoding.
% \item |macce| Macintosh Central European code page.
% \item |next| Next encoding.
% \item |cp1250| Windows 1250 (central and eastern Europe) code page.
% \item |cp1252| Windows 1252 (Western Europe) code page.
% \item |cp1257| Windows 1257 (Baltic) code page.
% \item |ansinew| Windows 3.1 ANSI encoding, extension of Latin-1
%       (synonym\footnote{It is now generated using the guards
%       \texttt{cp1252,ansinew} the latter only used for the provides
%       file line.} for |cp1252|).
% \item |utf8| Unicode UTF-8 encoding support.
% \end{itemize}
%
%
%
% \subsection{8-bit input encoding support}
%
% The \texttt{inputenc} package makes the upper 8-bit characters active and
%    assigns to all of them an error message. It then waits for the
%    input encoding definitions to change this set-up.  Similarly, whenever
%    |\inputencoding| is encountered in a document, first the upper
%    8-bit characters are set back to produce an error and then the
%    definitions for the new input encoding are loaded, changing some of the
%    previous settings.
%
%
%
% Each encoding has an associated |.def| file, for example
% |latin1.def| which defines the behaviour of each input character,
% using the commands:
% \begin{quote}
%    |\DeclareInputText{|\emph{slot}|}{|\emph{text}|}| \\
%    |\DeclareInputMath{|\emph{slot}|}{|\emph{math}|}|
% \end{quote}
% This defines the input character \emph{slot} to be the
% \emph{text} material or \emph{math} material respectively.
% For example, |latin1.def| defines slots |"D6| (\AE)
% and |"B5| ($\mu$) by saying:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \DeclareInputText{214}{\AE}
%    \DeclareInputMath{181}{\mu}
%\end{verbatim}
% Note that the \emph{commands} should be robust, and should not be
% dependent on the output encoding.  The same \emph{slot} should not
% have both a text and a math declaration for it. (This restriction
% may be removed in future releases of inputenc).
%
% The |.def| file may also define
% commands using the declarations:\\
% |\providecommand| or |\ProvideTextCommandDefault|.
% For example:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \ProvideTextCommandDefault{\textonequarter}{\ensuremath{\frac14}}
%    \DeclareInputText{188}{\textonequarter}
%\end{verbatim}
%    The use of the `provide' forms here will ensure that a
%    better definition will not be over-written; their use is
%    recommended since, in general, the best definition depends on the
%    fonts available.
%
%    See the documentation in |fntguide.tex| and |ltoutenc.dtx| for
%    details of how to declare text commands.
%
%
% \subsection{UTF-8 encoding support}
%
%
% The Unicode UTF-8 support works differently. It too uses a |.def| file
% (i.e., |utf8.def|) but this file does not contain code point declarations
% via the commands |\DeclareInputText| or |\DeclareInputMath|.
% Instead it defines a number of
% parsing commands that parse UTF-8 characters and then provides the
% corresponding \LaTeX{} definitions (if possible).
%
% Unfortunately the number of Unicode characters that in theory could be
% contained in a document is enormous. Thus even with today's amount of
% computer memory it would be unrealistic to predefine all of them. Therefore the
% approach taken by \LaTeX{} is as follows:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
%   At the start of the document (|\begin{document}|) it examines all font
%   encodings that are being used within the current document.
% \item
%   For each such font encoding it loads all known UTF-8 mappings that generate
%   characters from this font encoding.
% \item
%   All other UTF-8 characters remain undefined and will produce an error
%   message if they appear in the document.
% \end{itemize}
%
% The rationale behind this approach is that UTF-8 characters that do not
% correspond to any glyph within the used font encodings cannot be represented
% by \LaTeX{} anyway (without loading a font containing the glyph, which in
% turn should ``hopefully'' set up the corresponding UTF-8 mapping).
%
% This works well enough for the main Western languages for which \LaTeX{}
% has proper font encoding support, but currently already falls short on
% languages like Greek (which has some semi-official font support, but for
% which corresponding UTF-8 mappings still need to be defined).
%
% For some languages (such as Greek mentioned above) all that remains doing is
% to provide the necessary mappings and stick them into |utf8ienc.dtx|, so
% volunteers are welcome. For other languages that do not fit well into
% \LaTeX{} font selection scheme, e.g., Asian languages the outlined inputenc
% approach will not work. If that is the case one can try using Dominique
% Unruh's option |utf8x| for inputenc which has a somewhat different approach
% and encodes many more UTF-8 characters than the standard |utf8| option.
% However, we recommend to do so only if you really need such alphabets as
% there are problems with this extended approach which were precisely the
% reason that we decided to limit the support to what is properly supported
% within the boundaries of \LaTeX's font selection.
%
% If a UTF-8 mapping is missing and it is known to what \LaTeX{} definition it
% should map to, one can manually define it using a |\DeclareUnicodeCharacter|
% declaration. This declaration is available after inputenc has been loaded
% with the |utf8| option.
%
% The |\DeclareUnicodeCharacter| takes UTF-8 code point as its first argument
% (in form of a a hexadecimal number) and the definition that this maps to as
% its second argument. For example, the code point |00E4| which is
% ``LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS'' would be set up via:
%\begin{verbatim}
%   \DeclareUnicodeCharacter{00E4}{\"a}
%\end{verbatim}
% Conceptually the second argument should only contain ``encoding-specific
% commands'' as defined by \LaTeX{} font encoding concept, i.e., commands that
% automatically change behavior if the font encoding changes (see chapter~7 of
% the \LaTeX{} Companion for details).
%
% For details of the mappings per font encoding and some more technical
% information see the file \texttt{utf8ienc.dtx} that provides UTF-8 support
% using the \textsf{inputenc} package interface.
%
%
%
%
% \subsection{Error messages}
%
% In certain situations the inputenc package generates one of the following
% three error messages.
%
% \subsubsection{\normalfont\ttfamily Keyboard character used is undefined  in
% inputencoding `\meta{name}'}

% The document contains an 8-bit character that is not defined by the
% current input encoding in force. This means that either there is a
% mismatch between the document encoding that the document claims it
% is in (the option to inputenc) and the real encoding this document
% is encoded in. These days more often you find that UTF-8 is used as
% the encoding when saving a file in some text editor.
%
% Of course, it is also possible that the input encoding |.def| file is
% defective and the offending code point is simply missing from that file.
% Please check if the encoding file is one of the list above prior to
% reporting an error---on the net there are many additional encoding files
% supported by third parties.
%
%
%
% \subsubsection{\normalfont\ttfamily Cannot define Unicode char value < 00A0}
%
% This error message is shown if one tries to define a UTF-8 character
% with a code point lower than |00A0|. Those cannot be defined in
% \LaTeX{} through the |\DeclareUnicodeCharacter|.
%
%
% \subsubsection{\normalfont\ttfamily Unicode char \meta{charcode} not set up
% for use with LaTeX}
%
% This is the dreaded error message that one will receive if the
% document contains an UTF-8 character that isn't known to \LaTeX{}.
% It is quite possible that the character looks very unsuspicious and
% is rendered perfectly in the editor.
%
% For example, when entering a Euro symbol from the keyboard one may receive
% this error rather than a typeset symbol. But if this happens the reason is
% simply that the document doesn't load a font containing the Euro symbol,
% e.g., via the |textcomp| package. Thus \LaTeX{} does not know how to typeset
% one and therefore responds with this error message.
%
% However, even if \LaTeX{} can type that character in question it may not
% have been set up in which case you would need to do that yourself via
% |\DeclareUnicodeCharacter|. If you provide these declarations for a full
% font encoding then please contribute that work to this package so that
% others can benefit too.
%
%
%
%

% \subsection{Programmers interface}
%
% To better support packages that manage their own character mappings and
% therefore have to react to input encoding changes, the following three
% commands have been added in version 1.1a:
%
% \DescribeMacro\inputencodingname This command stores the name of the current
% input encoding.
%
% \DescribeMacro\inpenc@prehook
% \DescribeMacro\inpenc@posthook These two are token registers that are
% executed whenever an |\inputencoding| change happens. The first is executed at
% the very beginning, i.e., with |\inputencodingname| still pointing to the
% encoding name currently in place while the second one is executed at the very
% end, i.e., when |\inputencoding| has build a new mapping.
%
% Packages making use of this new features should consider including the
% following line
%\begin{verbatim}
%   \NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}[2005/12/01]
%\end{verbatim}
% as these commands haven't been available in \textsf{inputenc} distributed
% with older releases of \LaTeX{}.

%
% Before we start with the code, an important comment is in order:
% as you may or may not know, the |tabbing| environment changes the
% definition of the commands |\'|, |\`|, and |\=|. Outside such an
% environment these commands produce the corresponding accents, inside
% they are used for special text positioning, and the accents can be
% accessed using |\a'|, |\a`|, and |\a=|. Therefore we \emph{must} use
% the latter instead of the former in the second argument to
% |\DeclareInputText|, e.g. (from |latin1.def|):
% \begin{verbatim}
%     \DeclareInputText{224}{\@tabacckludge`a}
%\end{verbatim}
% The command |\@tabacckludge| is defined (in |ltoutenc.dtx|) in such
% a way that |\@tabacckludge'| will expand to the internal form of |\'|.
% Thus it is |\'| that is carried around \emph{internally} (the
% same applies to the other two accent commands).
%
% \begin{macro}{\DeclareInputText}
% \begin{macro}{\DeclareInputMath}
% \begin{macro}{\IeC}
%    These commands declare the expansion of an active character.  The
%    math declaration is the usual trick with |\uppercase|.
%    The text declaration is sneakier, since in text space matters.
%    We look to see if the definition ends in a macro, by checking
%    whether it's |\meaning| ends in a space.  If it does, then we
%    add an irrelevant |\IeC| and braces around the definition, in
%    order to avoid any space after the active char being gobbled up
%    once the text is written out to an auxiliary file.
%
%    The definition should contain only robust commands (and, for
%    correct ligatures and kerning, they must be defined via the
%    interfaces in the fontenc package).

% \section{Default definitions for characters}
%
%    Some input characters map to internal functions which are not in
%    either the |T1| or |OT1| font encoding. For this reason default
%    definitions are provided in the encoding file: these will be
%    used unless some other output encoding is used which supports
%    those glyphs.  In some cases this default definition has to be
%    simply an error message.
%
%    Note that this works reasonably well only because the encoding
%    files for both |OT1| and |T1| are loaded in the standard LaTeX
%    format.

%
% The ISO Latin-4 encoding file defines the characters in the ISO
% 8859-4 encoding. It was contributed by Hana Skoumalov\'a
% (\texttt{hana.skoumalova@ff.cuni.cz}).
%
% It was created for Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Finnish, Lappish,
% Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Icelandic and Greenlandic Inuit. Some
% alphabets, however, are incomplete (Greenlandic, Icelandic and Lappish).
% Some glyphs are not available in the fonts. For example, the
% Greenlandic character `kra' is not available at all;
% the Latvian and Lithuanian characters not
% contained in other encodings are constructed from components and
% they do not look good.

% \section{The MS Windows ANSI encoding cp1252,\\
%          and the ISO Latin-1 and Latin-9 encodings}
%
% The MS Windows ANSI, cp 1252, input encoding was contributed by
% Berthold K.P. Horn (\texttt{bkph@\linebreak[0]ai.mit.edu}).
%
% It has two very different names so the same code produces two files.
% These encoding files both define the characters in the
% MS Windows 3.1 ANSI encoding (Western Europe), also known as code
% page 1252, which is based on ISO Latin-1 but has important additions
% in the 128--159 range.
%
% Designed for:
%       Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Icelandic,
%       Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish.
%
% Note: Windows ANSI --- like Macintosh standard Roman encoding ---
%       has quotesingle at 39, and grave at 96 --- which is here
%       ignored.
%
% The ISO Latin-1 encoding file defines only the restricted range of
% characters available in the ISO~8859-1 encoding.
%
% The ISO~Latin-9 encoding file defines the characters in the
%    ISO~8859-15 encoding. It was contributed by Karsten Tinnefeld
%    (\texttt{karsten@tinnefeld.com}).
%    It differs only a small amount from ISO~Latin-1 and is a
%    replacement for it that contains a few characters that are needed for
%    French and Finnish. Further, a slot for the Euro currency sign has
%    been added and this could be the killer argument for many 8-bit
%    texts to be written in Latin-9 in the future.
%
% According to a Linux man page, ISO~Latin-9 supports Albanian, Basque,
%    Breton, Catalan, Danish, Dutch,
% English, Estonian, Faroese, Finnish, French, Frisian, Galician, German,
% Greenlandic, Icelandic, Irish Gaelic, Italian, Latin, Luxemburgish,
% Norwegian, Portuguese, Rhaeto-Romanic, Scottish Gaelic, Spanish and
% Swedish.
%
%    The characters added in |latin9.def| are (in \LaTeX{} notation):
% \begin{verbatim}
%     \texteuro, \v S   \v s   \v Z   \v z   \OE   \oe   \" Y
% \end{verbatim}
%    They displace the following characters from |latin1.def|:
% \begin{verbatim}
%       \textcurrency   \textbrokenbar   \"{}   \'{}   \c{}
%       \textonequarter   \textonehalf   \textthreequarters

%
% \changes{v1.0c}{2004/02/04}{Added ISO 8859-16 Latin10 (pr/3568)}
%
%  This set of coded graphic characters is intended for use in data and
%  text processing applications and also for information interchange. The
%  set contains graphic characters used for general purpose applications in
%  typical office environments in at least the following languages:
%  Albanian, Croatian, English, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Irish
%  Gaelic (new orthography), Italian, Latin, Polish, Romanian, and
%  Slovenian. This set of coded graphic characters may be regarded as a
%  version of an 8-bit code according to ISO/IEC 2022 or ISO/IEC 4873 at
%  level 1. [ISO 8859-16:2001(E), p. 1]
%
%  ISO 8859-16 was primarily designed for single-byte encoding the Romanian
%  language. The UTF-8 charset is the preferred and in today's MIME software
%  more widely implemented encoding suitable for Romanian.
%
% Data for the \LaTeX{} support was mainly provided by  Ionel Ciob\^{i}c\u{a}
% with additions and corrections taken from\\
% \texttt{http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/ISO8859/8859-16.TXT}.
