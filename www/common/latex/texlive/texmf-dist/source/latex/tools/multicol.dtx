%% Package `multicol' to use with LaTeX2e
%% Copyright 1989-2015 Frank Mittelbach
%%
%%  In addition to the terms of LPPL any distributed version
%%  (unchanged or modified) of multicol has to keep the statement
%%  about the moral obligation for using multicol. In case of major
%%  changes where this would not be appropriate the author of the
%%  changed version should contact the copyright holder.
%%
%%
%%  Moral obligation for using multicol:
%%  ------------------------------------
%%
%%  Users of multicol who wish to include or use multicol or a modified
%%  version in a proprietary and commercially market product are asked
%%  under certain conditions (see below) for the payment of a license
%%  fee.  The size of this fee is to be determined, in each instance,
%%  by the commercial user, depending on his/her judgment of the value of
%%  multicol for his/her product.
%%
%%
%%  The conditions for this are as follows:
%%
%%   The producer of a proprietary and commercially market product
%%   that involves typesetting using multicol is asked to determine
%%   the value of a license fee for using multicol if
%%
%%   - the product is a document and the producer has decided to
%%     include multicol to typeset (parts of) the document or has
%%     directed the author of the document to include multicol (for
%%     example, by providing a class file to be used by the author)
%%
%%   - the product is a LaTeX class or package that includes multicol
%%
%%
%%   There is no moral obligation in case
%%
%%   - the product is a document but producer has not directed
%%     the author to include multicol (in that case the moral obligation
%%     lies with the author of the document)
%%
%%   - the product does not involve typesetting, e.g., consists, for
%%     example, of distributing multicol and its documentation.
%%
%%   - the product is not proprietary, i.e., is made available as free
%%     software itself (which doesn't prohibit its commercial marketing)
%%
%%   - multicol is used for non-commercial purposes
%%
%%
%% Determining a license fee might result in a license fee of zero
%% (i.e., no payment) in case a producer has determined that the use
%% of multicol has no enhancing effect on the product. This is a
%% plausible scenario, i.e., in the above two cases the producer is
%% only asked to evaluate the value of multicol for the product
%% not for the payment of a license fee per se (which might or might
%% not follow from this evaluation).
%%
%% The license fee, if any, can be payed either to the LaTeX3 fund
%% (see ltx3info.txt in the base LaTeX distribution) or to the author of
%% the program who can be contacted at
%%

% \begin{abstract}
%   This article describes the use and the implementation of the \mc{}
%   environment. This environment allows switching between
%   one and multicolumn format on the same page. Footnotes are handled
%   correctly (for the most part), but will be placed at the bottom of
%   the page and not under each column.  \LaTeX{}'s float mechanism,
%   however, is partly disabled in this implementation.  At the
%   moment only page-wide floats (i.e., star-forms) can be used within
%   the scope of the environment.
% \end{abstract}
%
% \begin{multicols}{3}[\section*{Preface to version 1.8}]
%    The 1.8 release improves on the balancing approach. If due to a
%    limited number of break points (e.g., due to large objects) the
%    balanced columns exceed the available vertical space, then
%    balancing is canceled and a normal page is produced first. Some
%    overflow is allowed (controlled by the parameter
%    |\maxbalancingoverflow| which defaults to 12pt). This ensures
%    that we only cut a normal page if we get enough material carried
%    over to next page.
%
%    Also added was support for |\enlargethispage|. This means it is
%    now possible to request a page to be artificially  enlarged or
%    shortened. Note that if you enlarge pages by more than one line
%    you may have to increase the {\sf collectmore} counter value to
%    ensure that enough material is being picked up.
%
%    This command was used on the second page of this manual to shorten
%    it by one line, in order to get rid of a number of widow lines on
%    the following pages.
%
%
%    Finally, version 1.8 adds the command |\docolaction| to help with
%   more complicated actions that depend on the current column. This
%   command expects 3 arguments: code that is executed if we are in
%   the ``first'' column, code to execute if we end up in any
%   ``middle'' column (if there are more than two) and finally code to
%   execute if we are in the ``last'' column. Thus
%\begin{verbatim}
%  \docolaction{first}
%              {middle}{last}
%\end{verbatim}
%   would typeset a different word depending the type of column this
%   code is executed. Using it like this is probably pointless, but
%   you can imagine applications like writing something into the
%   nearest margin, etc.
%
%   As this feature needs at least two \LaTeX{} runs to produce correct
%   results and as it adds to the processing complexity it is only
%   made available if one add the option \texttt{colaction} when
%   loading the package.

%
% \begin{multicols}{3}[\section*{Preface to version 1.7
%                         (right to left support)}]
%    The 1.7 release adds support for languages that are typeset
%    right-to-left. For those languages the order of the columns on the page
%    also need to be reversed---something that wasn't supported before. This
%    paragraph demonstrates the result (as it is typeset as if we are writing
%    in a left-to-right language---so restart reading the rightmost column
%    first if you started with this column).
% \end{multicols}
%
% \LRmulticolcolumns
%
% \begin{multicols}{3}
%    Right-to-left typesetting will only reverse the column orders. Any
%    other support needed will have to be provided by other means,
%    e.g., using appropriate fonts and reversing the writing directions
%    within the columns. As footnotes are typeset in full measure the
%    footnote rule needs to be redefined as if they are below a single
%    column, i.e., using |\textwidth| not |\columnwidth|. For example:
%\begin{verbatim}
%\renewcommand \footnoterule{%
%  \kern-3pt\hbox to\textwidth
%    {\hskip .6\textwidth
%     \hrulefill }%
%  \kern2.6pt}
%\end{verbatim}
% \end{multicols}
%
%
% \begin{multicols}{3}[\section*{Preface to version 1.5 + 1.6}]
%   \hbadness=10000
%   The 1.5 release contains two major changes: \mc{} will now
%   support up to 10 columns and two more tuning possibilities have
%   been added to the balancing routine. The balancing routine now
%   checks the badness
%   of the resulting columns and rejects solutions that are larger
%   than a certain threshold.
%   At the same time \mc{} has been upgraded to run under \LaTeXe{}.
%
%   Later changes to 1.5 include |\columnbreak| and |multicols*|.
%
%   For version 1.6 micro-spacing around the boxes produced by \mc{}
%   has been improved to allow for baseline-grid typesetting.
% \end{multicols}
%

% \setcounter{collectmore}{2}
% \begin{multicols}{3}[\section{Introduction}]
%   \hbadness=10000
%   Switching between two-column and one-column layout is possible in
%   \LaTeX{}, but every use of |\twocolumn| or |\onecolumn|
%   starts a new page. Moreover, the last page of two-column output
%   isn't balanced and this often results in an empty, or nearly
%   empty, right column. When I started to write macros for {\sf
%   doc.sty} (see ``The {\tt doc}--Option'', \TUB\
%   volume 10~\#2, pp.~245--273) I thought that it would be nice to
%   place the index
%   on the same page as the bibliography. And balancing the last page
%   would not only look better, it also would save space; provided of
%   course that it is also possible to start the next article on the
%   same page. Rewriting the index environment was comparatively easy,
%   but the next goal, designing an environment which takes care of
%   footnotes, floats, etc., was a harder task. It took me a whole
%   weekend\footnote{I started with the algorithm given in the \TeX
%   book on page 417. Without this help a weekend would not have been
%   enough. (This remark was made in the documentation of the initial
%    release, since then several hundreds more hours went into
%    improving the original code.)} to get together the few lines of
%    code below and there is
%   still a good chance that I missed something after all.
%
%   Try it and, hopefully, enjoy it; and {\em please\/} direct bug
%   reports and suggestions back to Mainz.

%
% \setcounter{collectmore}{0}
% \begin{multicols}{3}[\section{The User Interface}]
%   \hbadness=10000
%   To use the environment one simply says\\*[2mm]
%     \hspace*{2mm}|\begin{multicols}{|\meta{number}|}|
%     \hspace*{12mm}\meta{multicolumn text}\\
%     \hspace*{2mm}|\end{multicols}|\\[2mm]
%   where \meta{number} is the required number of columns and
%^^A\meta{multicolumn text}
%   $\langle${\it multi\-column text\/}$\rangle$ may contain arbitrary
%   \LaTeX{} commands, except that floats and marginpars are not
%   allowed in the current implementation\footnote{This is dictated by
%   lack of time.  To implement floats one has to reimplement the
%   whole \LaTeX{} output routine.}.
%
% \enlargethispage{-1\baselineskip}
%
% \DescribeMacro\premulticols
% As its first action, the {\sf multicols} environment measures the
% current page to determine whether there is enough room for some
% portion of multicolumn output. This is controlled by the
% \meta{dimen} variable |\premulticols| which can be changed by
% the user with ordinary \LaTeX{} commands.
% \DescribeMacro\multicolsep
% If the space is less than |\premulticols|, a new page is
% started.  Otherwise, a |\vskip| of |\multicolsep| is
% added.\footnote{Actually the added space may be less because we use
% \cs{addvspace} (see the \LaTeX{} manual for further
% information about this command).}
%
% \DescribeMacro\postmulticols
% When the end of the \mc{} environment is encountered, an
% analogous mechanism is employed, but now we test whether there is a
% space larger than |\postmulticols| available. Again we add
% |\multicolsep| or start a new page.
%
% It is often convenient to spread some text over all columns, just
% before the multicolumn output, without any page break in between. To
% achieve this the \mc{} environment has an optional second
% argument which can be used for this purpose. For example, the text
% you are now reading was started with
% \begin{verbatim}
% \begin{multicols}{3}
%   [\section{The User
%             Interface}] ...
%\end{verbatim}
% If such text is unusually long (or short) the value of
% |\premulticols| might need adjusting to prevent a bad page
% break.  We therefore provide a third argument which can be used to
% overwrite the default value of |\premulticols| just for this
% occasion. So if you want to combine some longer single column text
% with a multicols environment you could write
% \begin{verbatim}
% \begin{multicols}{3}
%     [\section{Index}
%      This index contains ...]
%     [6cm]
%  ...
%\end{verbatim}
%
%
% \DescribeMacro\columnsep
% The space between columns is controlled by the length parameter
% |\columnsep|. The width for the individual columns is automatically
% calculated from this parameter and the current |\linewidth|. In this
% article a value of \textsf{\the\columnsep} was used.
%
%
% \DescribeMacro\columnseprule
% Separation of columns with vertical rules is achieved by setting the
% parameter |\columnseprule| to some positive value.  In this
% article a value of {\sf.4pt} was used.
%
% \DescribeMacro\columnseprulecolor
% The color of the rules separating the columns can be specified through
% |\columnseprulecolor|. The default value is |\normalcolor|.
%
% \DescribeMacro\multicolbaselineskip
% Since narrow columns tend to need adjustments in interline spacing
% we also provide a \meta{skip} parameter called
% |\multicolbaselineskip| which is added to the
% |\baselineskip| parameter inside the \mc{}
% environment.  Please use this parameter with care or leave it alone;
% it is intended only for package file designers since even small
% changes might produce totally unexpected changes to your document.
%
%
%    \subsection{Balancing columns}
%
%
% Besides the previously mentioned parameters, some others are
% provided to influence the layout of the columns generated.
%
% Paragraphing in \TeX{} is controlled by several parameters. One of
% the most important is called |\tolerance|: this controls the
% allowed `looseness' (i.e.\ the amount of blank space between words).
% Its default value is 200 (the \LaTeX{} |\fussy|) which is too
% small for narrow columns. On the other hand the |\sloppy|
% declaration (which sets |\tolerance| to $10000=\infty$) is too
% large, allowing really bad spacing.\footnote{Look at the next
% paragraph, it was set with the \cs{sloppy} declaration.}
%
% \begin{sloppypar}
% \DescribeMacro\multicoltolerance \DescribeMacro\multicolpretolerance
%  We therefore use a |\multicoltolerance| parameter for the
% |\tolerance| value inside the \mc{} environment.  Its default value
% is 9999 which is less than infinity but `bad' enough for most
% paragraphs in a multicolumn environment. Changing its value should
% be done outside the \mc{} environment.  Since |\tolerance| is set
% to |\multicoltolerance| at the beginning of every {\sf multicols}
% environment one can locally overwrite this default by assigning
% \verb*+\tolerance = +\meta{desired value}. There also exists a
% |\multicolpretolerance| parameter holding the value for
% |\pretolerance| within a \mc{} environment. Both parameters are
% usually used only by package designers.
% \end{sloppypar}
%
% Generation of multicolumn output can be divided into two parts.  In
% the first part we are collecting material for a page, shipping it
% out, collecting material for the next page, and so on.  As a second
% step, balancing will be done when the end of the \mc{} environment
% is reached.
% In the first step \TeX{} might consider more material whilst
% finding the final column content than it actually uses when shipping out the
% page. This might cause a problem if a footnote is encountered in
% the part of the input considered, but not used, on the current page.
% In this case the footnote might show up on the current page, while the
% footnotemark corresponding to this footnote might be set on the next
% one.\footnote{The reason behind this behavior is the asynchronous
%               character of the \TeX{} {\it page\_builder}.
%               However, this
%               could be avoided by defining very complicated output
%               routines which don't use \TeX{} primitives like
%               \cs{insert} but do everything by hand.
%               This is clearly beyond the scope of a weekend problem.}
% Therefore the \mc{} environment gives a warning
% message\footnote{This message will be generated even if there are no
% footnotes in this part of the text.} whenever it is unable to use
% all the material considered so far.
%
% If you don't use footnotes too often the chances of something
% actually going wrong are very slim, but if this happens you can help
% \TeX{} by using a |\pagebreak| command in the final document.
% Another way to influence the behavior of \TeX{} in this respect is
% given by the counter variable `{\sf collectmore}'. If you use the
% |\setcounter| declaration to set this counter to \meta{number},
% \TeX{} will consider \meta{number} more (or less) lines before
% making its final decision. So a value of $-1$ may solve all your
% problems at the cost of slightly less optimal columns.
%
%
% In the second step (balancing columns) we have other bells and
% whistles. First of all you can say |\raggedcolumns| if you
% don't want the bottom lines to be aligned.
% The default is |\flushcolumns|, so \TeX{} will normally try to
% make both
% the top and bottom baselines of all columns align.
%
% Additionally you can set another counter, the `{\sf unbalance}'
% counter, to some positive \meta{number}. This will make all but the
% right-most column \meta{number} of lines longer than they would
% normally have been. `Lines' in this context refer to normal text
% lines (i.e.\ one |\baselineskip| apart); thus, if your columns
% contain displays,
% for example, you may need a higher \meta{number}
% to shift something from one column into another.
%
% Unlike `{\sf collectmore},' the `{\sf unbalance}' counter is reset
% to zero at the end of the environment so it only applies to one
% \mc{} environment.
%
% The two methods may be combined but I suggest using these features
% only when fine tuning important publications.
%
% Two more general tuning possibilities were added with version~1.5.
% \TeX{} allows to measure the badness of a column in terms of an
% integer value, where 0 means optimal and any higher value means a
% certain amount of extra white space. 10000 is considered to be
% infinitely bad (\TeX{} does not distinguish any further). In addition
% the special value 100000 means overfull (i.e., the column contains
% more text than could possibly fit into it).
%
% The new release now measures every generated column and ignores
% solutions where at least one column has a badness being larger than
% the value of the counter {\sf columnbadness}. The default value for
% this counter is 10000, thus \TeX{} will accept all solutions except
% those being overfull.
% By setting the counter to a smaller value you can force the algorithm
% to search for solutions that do not have columns with a lot of white
% space.
%
% However, if the setting is too low, the algorithm may not find any
% acceptable solution at all and will then finally choose the extreme
% solution of placing all text into the first column.
%
% Often, when columns are balanced, it is impossible to find a solution
% that distributes the text evenly over all columns. If that is the case
% the last column usually has less text than the others. In the earlier
% releases this text was stretched to produce a column with the same
% height as all others, sometimes resulting in really ugly looking
% columns.
%
% In the new release this stretching is only done if the badness of
% the final column is not larger than the value of the counter
% {\sf finalcolumnbadness}. The default setting is 9999, thus preventing
% the stretching for all columns that \TeX{} would consider infinitely
% bad. In that case the final column is allowed to run short which gives
% a much better result.
%
% And there are two more parameters of some experimental nature, one
% called |\multicolovershoot| the other |\multicolundershoot|.  They
% control the amount of space a column within the \mc{} environment is
% allowed to be ``too full'' or ``too short'' without affecting the
% column badness. They are set to 0pt and 2pt, respectively.
%
% Finally, when doing the balancing at the end, columns may become
% higher than the remaining available space. In that case the
% algorithm aborts and instead generates a normal page. However, if the
% amount is not too large, e.g., a line or so, then it might be better to
% keep everything on the same page instead of starting a new page with
% just one line after balancing. So the parameter
% |\maxbalancingoverflow| governs this process: only when the excess
% gets larger than its value balancing is aborted.
%
% \subsection{Not balancing the columns}
%
% Although this package was written to solve the problem of balancing
% columns, I got repeated requests to provide a version where all
% white space is automatically placed in the last column or
% columns. Since version v1.5q this now exists: if you use
% \texttt{multicols*} instead of the usual environment the columns on
% the last page are not  balanced. Of course, this environment only
% works on top-level, e.g., inside a box one has to balance to
% determine a column height in absence of a fixed value.
%
%
% \subsection{Manually breaking columns}
%
% Another request often voiced was: ``How do I tell \LaTeX{} that it
% should break the first column after this particular line?''. The
% |\pagebreak| command (which works with the two-column option of
% \LaTeX{}) is of no use here since it would end the collection phase
% of \mc{} and thus all columns on that page. So with version 1.5u
% the |\columnbreak| command was added. If used within a paragraph it
% marks the end of the current line as the desired breakpoint. You can
% observe its effect on
% the previous page where three lines of text have been artificially
% forced into the second column  (resulting in some white
% space between paragraphs in the first column).
%
% \subsection{Floats inside a \mc{} environment}
%
% Within the \mc{} environment the usual star float commands are
% available but their function is somewhat different as in the
% two-column mode of standard \LaTeX. Stared floats, e.g., {\tt
% figure*}, denote page wide floats that are handled in a similar
% fashion as normal floats outside the \mc{} environment. However,
% they will never show up on the page where they are encountered. In
% other words, one can influence their placement by specifying a
% combination of {\tt t}, {\tt b}, and/or {\tt p} in their optional
% argument, but {\tt h} doesn't work because the first possible place
% is the top of the next page. One should also note, that this means
% that their placement behavior is determined by the values of
% |\topfraction|, etc.\ rather than by |\dbl...|.
%
%
% \subsection{Support for right-to-left typesetting}
%
%    In right-to-left typesetting the order of the columns on the page
%    also need to be reversed, i.e., the first column has to appear on the far
%    right and the last column on the left. This is supported through the
%    commands |\RLmulticolcolumns| (switching to right-to-left typesetting)
%    and |\LRmulticolcolumns| (switching to left-to-right typesetting) the
%    latter being the default.
%
% \subsection{Warnings}
%
% Under certain circumstances the use of the \mc{} environment may
% result in some
% warnings from \TeX{} or \LaTeX{}. Here is a list
% of the important ones and the possible cause:
% \begin{description}
%
% \item[] {\hspace*{-\labelsep}\tt Underfull \string\hbox\space
%  (badness ...)}
%
%  As the columns are often very narrow \TeX{} wasn't able to find a
%  good way to break the paragraph. Underfull denotes a loose line but
%  as long as the badness value is below $10000$ the result is probably
%  acceptable.
%
% \item[]
% {\hspace*{-\labelsep}\tt Underfull \string\vbox\space ...  while
%  \string\output\space is active}
%
%  If a column contains a character with an unusual depth, for
%  example a `(', in the bottom line then this message may show up. It
%  usually has no significance as long as the value is not more than a
%  few points.
%
% \item[] {\hspace*{-\labelsep}\tt LaTeX Warning: I moved some lines
%  to the next page}
%
%  As mentioned above, \mc{} sometimes screws up the footnote
%  numbering. As a precaution, whenever there is a footnote on a
%  page where \mc{} had to leave a remainder for the following
%  page this warning appears. Check the footnote numbering on this
%  page. If it turns out that it is wrong, you have to manually break
%  the page using |\newpage| or |\pagebreak[..]|.
%
% \item[] {\hspace*{-\labelsep}\tt Floats and marginpars not allowed
%  inside `multicols' environment!}
%
%  This message appears if you try to use the |\marginpar| command or
%  an unstarred version of the {\sf figure} or {\sf table} environment.
%  Such floats will disappear!
%
% \item[] {\hspace*{-\labelsep}\tt Very deep columns!
%          Grid alignment might be broken}
%
% This message can only appear if the option \texttt{grid} was
%    chosen. In that case it will show up if a column has a very large
%    depth so that \mc{} is unable to back up to its baseline. This
%    is only relevant if one tries to produce a document where all
%    text lines are aligned at an invisible grid, something that
%    requires careful adjustment of many parameters and macros, e.g.,
%    heading definitions.
%
% \end{description}
%
%
% \subsection{Tracing the output}
%
% To understand the reasoning behind the decisions \TeX{} makes when
% processing a \mc{} environment, a tracing mechanism is provided.
% If you set the counter `\texttt{tracingmulticols}'
% to a positive \meta{number} you then
% will get some tracing information on the terminal and in the
% transcript file:
% \begin{description}
% \item[$\meta{number}=1$.]  \TeX{} will now tell you, whenever it
%    enters or leaves a \mc{} environment, the number of columns it
%    is working on and its decision about starting a new page before
%    or after the environment.
% \item[$\meta{number}=2$.]
%    In this case you also get information from the balancing routine:
%    the heights tried for the left and right-most columns,
%    information about shrinking if the |\raggedcolumns|
%    declaration is in force and the value of the `{\sf unbalance}'
%    counter if positive.
% \item[$\meta{number}= 3$.]  Setting \meta{number}\pagebreak[2] to
%    this value will additionally trace the mark handling
%    algorithm. It will show what marks are found, what marks are
%    considered, etc. To fully understand this information you will
%    probably have to read carefully trough the implementation.
% \item[$\meta{number}\geq 4$.]  Setting \meta{number}\pagebreak[2] to
%    such a high value will additionally place an |\hrule| into your
%    output, separating the part of text which had already been
%    considered on the previous page from the rest.  Clearly this
%    setting should {\em not\/} be used for the final output.  It will
%    also activate even more debugging code for mark handling.
% \end{description}

% \begin{multicols}{3}[\section{Prefaces to older versions}
%                      \subsection{Preface to version 1.4}]
%   \hbadness=10000
%   Beside fixing some bugs as mentioned in the {\sf multicol.bug} file
%   this new release enhances the \mc{} environment by allowing for
%   balancing in arbitrary contexts. It is now, for example, possible
%   to balance text within a \mc{} or a {\sf minipage} as shown in
%   \ref{tab:newcmds} where a {\sf multicols} environment within a
%   {\sf quote} environment was used. It is now even possible to nest
%   \mc{} environments.
%
%   The only restriction to such inner \mc{} environments (nested, or
%   within \TeX's internal vertical mode) is that such variants will
%   produce a box with the balanced material in it, so that they can
%   not be broken across pages or columns.
%
%   Additionally I rewrote the algorithm for balancing so that it will
%   now produce slightly better results.
%
%   I updated the source documentation but like to apologize in
%   advance for some `left over' parts that slipped through the
%   revision.
%
%   A note to people who like to improve the balancing algorithm of
%   \mc{}: The balancing routine is now placed into a single macro
%   which is called |\balance@columns|. This means that one can easily
%   try different balancing routines by rewriting this macro. The
%   interface for it is explained in table \ref{tab:balance}. There are
%   several improvements possible, one can think of integrating the
%   |\badness| function of \TeX3, define a faster algorithm for finding
%   the right column height, etc. If somebody thinks he/she has an
%   enhancement I would be pleased to learn about it. But please obey
%   the copyright notice and don't change {\sf multicol.dtx} directly!
%   \begin{table*}
%    \begin{quote}
%    \begin{multicols}{2}
%     \raggedcolumns
%     The macro |\balance@columns| that contains the code for balancing
%     gathered material is a macro without parameters. It assumes that
%     the material for balancing is stored in the box |\mult@box| which
%     is a |\vbox|. It also ``knows'' about all parameters set up by the
%     \mc{} environment, like |\col@number|, etc. It can also assume
%     that |\@colroom| is the still available space on the current page.
%
%     When it finishes it must return the individual columns in boxes
%     suitable for further processing with |\page@sofar|. This means
%     that the left column should be stored in box register
%     |\mult@gfirstbox|, the next
%     in register |\mult@firstbox|${}+2$, \ldots,
%     only the last one as an exception in
%     register |\mult@grightbox|. Furthermore it has to set up
%     the two macros
%     |\kept@firstmark| and |\kept@botmark| to hold the values for the
%     first and bottom mark as found in the individual columns. There
%     are some helper functions defined in section \ref{sec:v14} which
%     may be used for this. Getting the marks right ``by hand'' is
%     non-trivial and it may pay off to first take a look at the
%     documentation and implementation of |\balance@columns| below
%     before trying anew.

%   \hbadness=10000
%   After the article about the \mc{} environment was published in
%   \TUB\ 10\#3, I got numerous requests for these macros. However, I
%   also got a changed version of my style file, together with a
%   letter asking me if I would include the changes to get better
%   paragraphing results in the case of narrow lines. The main
%   differences to my original style option were additional parameters
%   (like |\multicoladjdemerits| to be used for |\adjdemerits|, etc.)
%   which would influence the line breaking algorithm.
%
%   But actually resetting such parameters to zero or even worse to a
%   negative value won't give better line breaks inside the \mc{}
%   environment. \TeX{}s line breaking algorithm will only look at
%   those possible line breaks which can be reached without a badness
%   higher than the current value of |\tolerance| (or |\pretolerance|
%   in the first pass). If this isn't possible, then, as a last
%   resort, \TeX{} will produce overfull boxes. All those (and only
%   those) possible break points will be considered and finally the
%   sequence which results in the fewest demerits will be chosen. This
%   means that a value of $-1000$ for |\adjdemerits| instructs \TeX{}
%   to prefer visibly incompatible lines instead of producing better
%   line breaks.
%
%   However, with \TeX{} 3.0 it is possible to get decent line breaks
%   even in small columns by setting |\emergencystretch| to an
%   appropriate value. I implemented a version which is capable of
%   running both in the old and the new \TeX{} (actually it will
%   simply ignore the new feature if it is not available). The
%   calculation of |\emergencystretch| is probably incorrect. I
%   made a few tests but of course one has to have much more experience
%   with the new possibilities to achieve the maximum quality.
%
%   Version 1.1a had a nice `feature': the penalty for using the
%   forbidden floats was their ultimate removal from \LaTeX{}s
%   |\@freelist| so that after a few |\marginpar|s inside the \mc{}
%   environment floats where disabled forever.  (Thanks to Chris
%   Rowley for pointing this out.) I removed this misbehaviour and at
%   the same time decided to allow at least floats spanning all
%   columns, e.g., generated by the |figure*| environment.  You can
%   see the new functionality in table~\ref{tab:newcmds} which was
%   inserted at this very point.

%    First thing we do is to decide whether or not this is an
%    unbounded multicols environment, i.e. one that may split across
%    pages, or one that has to be typeset into a box. If we are in
%    \TeX's ``inner'' mode (e.g., inside a box already) then we have a
%    boxed version of multicols therefore we set the |@boxedmulticols|
%    switch to true.  The \mc{} should start in vertical mode. If we
%    are not already there we now force it with |\par| since otherwise
%    the test for ``inner'' mode wouldn't show if we are in a box.

%    Otherwise we check |\doublecol@number|. This counter is zero
%    outside a multicols environment but positive inside (this happens
%    a little later on). In the second case we need to process the

%    The |\enough@room| macro used

%    |\penalty|.\footnote{See the documentation of
%    \cs{endmulticols} for further details.}
%    Actually, we use |\addpenalty| to ensure that a following
%    |\addvspace| will `see' the vertical space that might be
%    present.
%    The use of |\addpenalty| will have the effect that all items from
%    the recent contributions will be moved to the main vertical list
%    and the |\pagetotal| value will be updated correctly. However,

%    Finally we need to record the marks that are present within the

%    \begin{macrocode}

%    Finally we have to initialize |\kept@topmark| which should
%    ideally be initialized with the mark that is current on ``top''
%    of this page. Unfortunately we can't use |\topmark| because this
%    register will not always contain what its name promises because
%    \LaTeX{} sometimes calls the output routine for float
%    management.\footnote{During such a call the \cs{botmark}
%    gets globally copied to \cs{topmark} by the \TeX{}
%    program.} Therefore we use the second best solution by

%    The next thing to do is to assign a new value to |\vsize|.
%    \LaTeX{} maintains the free room on the page (i.e.\ the page
%    height without the space for already contributed floats) in the
%    register |\@colroom|. We must subtract the height of
%    |\partial@page| to put the actual free room into this
%    variable.
%    \begin{macrocode}
    \advance\@colroom-\ht\partial@page
%    \end{macrocode}
%    Then we have to calculate the |\vsize| value to use during column
%    assembly. |\set@mult@vsize| takes an argument which allows to
%    make the setting local (|\relax|) or global (|\global|). The
%    latter variant is used inside the output routine below. At this
%    point here we have to make a local change to |\vsize| because we
%    want to get the original value for |\vsize| restored in case
%    this \mc{} environment ends on the same page where it has started.

%    \begin{macrocode}

%    \end{macrocode}
%    Finally we handle the footnote insertions. We have to multiply
%    the magnification factor and the extra skip by the number of
%    columns since each footnote reduces the space for every column
%    (remember that we have pagewide footnotes).  If, on the other
%    hand, footnotes are typeset at the very end of the document, our
%    scheme still works since |\count\footins| is zero then, so it
%    will not change.
%    To allow even further customization the setting of the |\footins|
%    parameters is done in a separate macro.
% \changes{v1.5?}{1994/?/?}{Use \cs{init@mult@footins}}
%    \begin{macrocode}

%    \end{macrocode}
%    For the same reason (pagewide footnotes), the \meta{dimen}
%    register controlling the maximum space used for footnotes isn't
%    changed.  Having done this, we must reinsert all the footnotes
%    which are already present (i.e.\ those encountered when the
%    material saved in |\partial@page| was first processed). This
%    will reduce the free space (i.e.\ |\pagetotal|) by the

%    factor, etc.\ above.
%    \begin{macrocode}

%    All the code above was only necessary for the unrestricted \mc{}

%    |\vsize|, etc.
%    \begin{macrocode}

%    \end{macrocode}
%    But now we are coming to code that is necessary in all cases.  We

%    Since nearly always the first pass will fail we ignore it

%                       I think that this is the best solution if you
%                       are interested in complex page makeup, but it
%                       has the disadvantage that the resulting
%                       program cannot be called \TeX{} thereafter.}
%    this simple trick saved us from rewriting the |\footnote|
%    macros. However, some applications referred to |\columnwidth| as
%    the ``width of the current column'' to typeset displays
%    (the \texttt{amsmath} package, for example) and to allow the use
%    of such applications together with \texttt{multicol} this is now
%    changed.
%
%    Before we change |\linewidth| to the new value we record its old
%    value in some register called |\full@width|. This value is
%    used later on when we package all columns together.

%    (an explicit \cs{penalty} will empty the contribution
%    list), but the line with the \cs{eject} didn't fit onto
%    the current page.  It was then reconsidered after the output
%    routine had ended, causing a second break after one line.}
%    Therefore we must also add an explicit |\penalty|.  Now the

%    If the \mc{} environment body was completely empty or if a

%    |\footins| parameter since we are returning to one column
%    mode. This will be done in the next line of code; we simply close
%    the group started in |\multicols|.
%
%    To fix an obscure bug which is the result of the current
%    definition of the |\begin| \ldots\ |\end| macros, we check that
%    we are still (logically speaking) in the \mc{} environment. If,

%    We also take a look at the amount of free space on the current
%    page to see if it's time for a page break.  The vertical space
%    added thereafter will vanish if |\enough@room| starts a new
%    page.
%
%    But there is one catch. If the |\end{multicols}| is at the top of
%    which can happen if there is a break point just before it (such
%    as end ending environment) which was chosen. In that case we
%    would do the next page using the internal |\vsize| for multicol
%    collection which is a disaster. So we better catch this

% We first start with some simple macros. When typesetting the page we

% to avoid an overflow of the save stack.
%
% \begin{macro}{\process@cols}
%    Therefore we define a |\process@cols| macro to help us in
%    using these registers in the output routines below. It has two
%    arguments: the first one is a number; the second one is the
%    processing information.  It loops starting with |\count@=#1|
%    (|\count@| is a scratch register defined in \PlainTeX),
%    processes argument |#2|, adds two to |\count@|,
%    processes argument |#2| again, etc.\ until |\count@| is
%    higher than |\doublecol@number|.  It might be easier to

%    |\balance@columns| prepares its output in the even numbered

%    Now we output the columns gathered assuming that they are saved

%
%    We need a global scratch register for this; using standard \TeX{}

%    \begin{macrocode}

%    But we must also subtract the space occupied by footnotes on the

%    We start by setting the kept marks by updating them with any

%    Then follow values assignments to get the |\vsplit|ting right.

%   We also have to set |\boxmaxdepth| which normally allows to
%   build boxes with arbitrary depth, but as we are building text
%   columns we really want to restrict the depth. This is necessary as
%   we sometimes rebox the boxes generated by |\vsplit| and then the

%    The next step is a bit tricky: when \TeX{} assembles material in
%    a box, the first line isn't preceded by interline glue, i.e.
%    there is no parameter like |\boxtopskip| in \TeX{}. This means
%    that the baseline of the first line in our box is at some
%    unpredictable point depending on the height of the largest
%    character in this line. But of course we want all columns to
%    align properly at the baselines of their first lines. For this
%    reason we have opened |\mult@box| with a |\penalty| {\sf -10000}.
%    This will now allow us to split off from |\mult@box| a tiny bit
%    (in fact nothing since the first possible break-point is the
%    first item in the box). The result is that |\splittopskip| is
%    inserted at the top of |\mult@box| which is exactly what we like

%    Next we try to find a suitable starting point for the calculation
%    of the column height.  It should be less than the height finally
%    chosen, but large enough to reach this final value in only a few
%    iterations.  The formula which is now implemented will try to
%    start with the nearest value which is a multiple of
%    |\baselineskip|. The coding is slightly tricky in \TeX{} and

%    The code above sets |\@tempdima| to the length of a column if we

%    lower multiple of |\baselineskip| we convert this dimen to a
%    number (the number of scaled points) then divide this by
%    |\baselineskip| (also in scaled points) and then multiply this

%    Now we try to find the final column height.  We start by setting

%    solution.  We do not need to do it in a group since at the end of

%    To ensure that there isn't a forced break in the last column we

%    (or rather from a copy of it). This should result in a void box

%  \begin{macro}{\kept@firstmark}
%  \begin{macro}{\kept@botmark}
%    First thing we do is to reserve three macro names to hold the
%    replacement text for \TeX's primitives |\firstmark|, |\botmark| and
%    |\topmark|. We initialize the first two to be empty and
%    |\kept@topmark| to contain  two empty pair of braces. This is
%    necessary since |\kept@topmark| is supposed to contain the last
%    mark from a preceding page and in \LaTeX{} any ``real'' mark must
%    contain two parts representing left and right mark information.

%
%
%  \begin{macro}{\return@nonemptymark}
%    Sometimes we want to return the value of a ``kept'' mark into a
%    |\mark| node on the main vertical list. This is done by the
%    function |\return@nonemptymark|. As the name suggests it only acts
%    if the replacement text of the kept mark is non-empty. This is done
%    to avoid adding an empty mark when no mark was actually present. If
%    we would nevertheless add such a mark it would be regarded as a
%    valid |\firstmark| later on.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\return@nonemptymark#1#2{%
  \ifx#2\@empty
  \else
%    \end{macrocode}
%    For debugging purposes we take a look at the value of the kept mark
%    that we are about to return. This code will get stripped out for

%    Since the contents of the mark may be arbitrary \LaTeX{} code we
%    better make sure that it doesn't get expanded any further. (Some
%    expansion have been done already during the execution of
%    |\markright| or |\markboth|.) We therefore use the usual mechanism
%    of a toks register to prohibit expansion.\footnote{Due to the
%    current definition of \cs{markright} etc.\ it wouldn't
%    help to define the \cs{protect} command to prohibit
%    expansion as any \cs{protect} has already vanished due to
%    earlier expansions.}

%    If we have some material in a box register we may want to get the

%    or its nick name defined by |\newbox|.
%    \begin{macrocode}

%    Now we open a new group an locally copy the box to itself. As a
%    result any operation, i.e.\ |\vsplit|, will only have a local
%    effect. Without this trick the box content would get lost up to
%    the level where the last assignment to the box register was done.

%    Now we split the box to the maximal possible dimension. This
%    should split off the full contents of the box so that effectively

%    respectively.
%    \begin{macrocode}
   \setbox#1\vsplit#1to\maxdimen

%    Therefore we can now set the kept marks which is a global

% \subsection{Manual column breaking} \label{sec:colbreak}
%
% The problem with manual page breaks within \mc{} is the fact that
% during collection of material for all columns a page-forcing penalty
% (i.e. -10000 or higher) would stop the collecting pass which is not
% quite what is desired. On the other hand, using a penalty like -9999
% would mean that there would be occasions where the |\vsplit|ing
% operations within \mc{} would ignore that penalty and still choose a
% different break point.
%
% For this reason the current implementation
% uses a completely different approach. In a nutshell it extends the \LaTeX{}
% output routine handling by introducing an additional penalty flag
% (i.e., a penalty which is forcing but higher than -10000 so that the
% output routine can look at this value and thus knows why it has been
% called).
%
% Inside the output routine we test for this value and if it appears
% we do two things: save the galley up to this point in a special box
% for later use and reduce the |\vsize| by the height of the material
% seen. This way the forcing penalty is now hidden in that box and we
% can restart the collection process for the remaining
% columns. (This is done in |\speci@ls| above.)
%
% In the output routines that do the |\vsplit|ting either for
% balancing or for a full page we simply combine box~255 with the
% saved box thus getting a single box for  splitting which now
% contains forcing breaks in the right positions.
%
%
%  \begin{macro}{\columnbreak}

%  \begin{macro}{\RL@column@boxes}
%    Assembling the boxes for right to left typesetting is far more
%    complicated. When I first tried to build a solution for this my
%    thinking was that all that is necessary to do is to reverse the
%    order of the columns. But such an approach produces a subtle bug:
%    If we work this way then the first column put on the page will be
%    the last column of the text to read. and this means that the
%    order in which \TeX{} executes write statements or assembles mark
%    material will not happen in the order of the textual flow. So if,
%    for example each column contains a section command then these
%    sections will appear in reverse order in the table of content.
%
%    For this reason some amount of gymnastics is needed to add the
%    columns in their natural flow.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\RL@column@boxes{%

%    At this point in the code our typesetting reference point is at
%    the right end of the rightmost column (or rather where that column
%    should appear).
%
%    We are now typesetting all columns by first backing up by their
%    width (which is |\hsize|) then typesetting the box and then
%    backing up again, but this time further, i.e., also across the
%    column separation. That will then enable us to typeset the next
%    column using the same approach until we are done with all but the
%    final column.

%    We prefix with 0 so that an unknown label (that returns
%   \verb=\relax=) will result in case 0
%    \begin{macrocode}
 \ifcase \mc@col@type\relax
%    \end{macrocode}
%    If column is unknown we use the default action or the action
%   denoted by the optional argument (so that arg can take the value
%   1, 2, 3).
%    \begin{macrocode}
     \ifcase #1\or #2\or#3\or#4\fi
  \or
%    \end{macrocode}
%    Otherwise we know (or think we know) that this is a first, middle,
%   or last column:
%    \begin{macrocode}
     #2%  % 1 First col
  \or
     #3%  % 2 any middle col
  \or
     #4%  % 3 last col
  \else
    \ERROR
  \fi
%    \end{macrocode}
%    But how does the column number get associated with our label? We
%   do do this by writing another line into the aux file at this point:
%    \begin{macrocode}
  \edef\next{\write\@auxout
     {\string\mc@set@col@status
      {mc@col-\the\mc@col@check@num}%
      {\mc@col@type}}}%
  \next
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%  \end{macro}
%
%   Because of extra data writing to the aux file the aux file will
%   now contain something like the following after the document is
%   processed the first time:
%\begin{verbatim}
%\relax
%\mc@col@status{1}
%\mc@set@col@status{lcol-1}{0}
%\mc@col@status{2}
%\mc@set@col@status{lcol-2}{0}
%\mc@col@status{3}
%\mc@set@col@status{lcol-3}{0}
%\mc@col@status{1}
%\mc@col@status{2}
%\mc@col@status{3}
%\mc@set@col@status{lcol-4}{0}
%\end{verbatim}
%   The \verb=\mc@col@status= line denotes the column type and has been
%   written out just before corresponding the column box was placed
%   onto the page.
%   The\verb=\mc@set@col@status= lines have been written out as part
%   of shipping the column boxes out, e.g.,
%   \verb=\mc@set@col@status{lcol-1}{0}= was therefore somewhere within
%   the first column as it appears between \verb=\mc@col@status{1}=
%   and  \verb=\mc@col@status{2}=
%   The second argument in that line is the value used in the previous
%   run (or zero if there was no previous run. We can use this to
%   determine if a rerun is necessary.
%
%   Thus with this knowledge we can set things up to get the labels
%   working.
%
%
%  \begin{macro}{\mc@col@status}
%
%   When the aux file is read in \verb=\mc@col@status= is used to set
%   \verb=\mc@curr@col@status=:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\mc@col@status#1{%
    \gdef\mc@curr@col@status{#1}}
%    \end{macrocode}
%  \end{macro}
%
%
%
%  \begin{macro}{\mc@set@col@status}
%
%   And when \verb=\mc@set@col@status= is executed we can simply set
%   up the label by associating it with the \verb=\mc@curr@col@status=
%   and ignore the second argument:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\mc@set@col@status#1#2{%
  \global\expandafter\let\csname #1\endcsname
                         \mc@curr@col@status}
%    \end{macrocode}
%   The above definition is being used when the \texttt{.aux} file is
%   read in at the beginning. At the end we need a different
%   definition to test if another typesetting run is needed. There we
%   compare the value used in the current run (stored in the second
%   argument) with the value used on the next run. If those two values
%   differ we set \verb=@tempswa= to false which will trigger the
%   ``Label(s) may have changed'' warning.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\AtEndDocument{\def\mc@set@col@status#1#2{%
     \ifnum #2=\mc@curr@col@status\else
       \@tempswatrue
     \fi}%
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%  \end{macro}
%
%
%  \begin{macro}{mc@firstcol}
%   Finally, as part of determining in which column we are, we used a
%   switch inside |\mc@col@status@write| to determine if we are in the
%   first column or not.
%  \begin{macrocode}
\newif\ifmc@firstcol
\mc@firstcoltrue
%    \end{macrocode}
%  \end{macro}
% \end{multicols*}
