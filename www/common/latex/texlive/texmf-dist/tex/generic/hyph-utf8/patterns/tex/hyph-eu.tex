% Hyphenation patterns for Basque.
%
% This file has first been written by Juan M. Aguirregabiria
% (juanmari.aguirregabiria@ehu.es) on February 1997 based on the
% shyphen.sh script that generates the Spanish patterns as compiled
% by Julio Sanchez (jsanchez@gmv.es) on September 1991.
%
% In June 2008 the generating script has been rewritten into ruby and
% adapted for native UTF-8 TeX engines. Patterns became part of hyph-utf8
% package and were renamed from bahyph.tex into hyph-eu.tex.
% Functionality should not change apart from adding ñ by default.
