                </li>

            <p><img alt="Image - Advanced Settings: Rotation" src="../images/image_properties_4.png" /></p>

			<p>The <b>Text Wrapping</b> tab contains the following parameters:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Wrapping Style</b> - use this option to change the way the image is positioned relative to the text: it will either be a part of the text (in case you select the inline style) or bypassed by it from all sides (if you select one of the other styles).
				<ul>
				    <li><p><div class = "icon icon-wrappingstyle_inline"></div> <b>Inline</b> - the image is considered to be a part of the text, like a character, so when the text moves, the image moves as well. In this case the positioning options are inaccessible.</p>
				    <p>If one of the following styles is selected, the image can be moved independently of the text and positioned on the page exactly:</p>
				    </li>
				    <li><p><div class = "icon icon-wrappingstyle_square"></div> <b>Square</b> - the text wraps the rectangular box that bounds the image.</p></li>
				    <li><p><div class = "icon icon-wrappingstyle_tight"></div> <b>Tight</b> - the text wraps the actual image edges.</p></li>
				    <li><p><div class = "icon icon-wrappingstyle_through"></div> <b>Through</b> - the text wraps around the image edges and fills in the open white space within the image. So that the effect can appear, use the <b>Edit Wrap Boundary</b> option from the right-click menu.</p></li>
				    <li><p><div class = "icon icon-wrappingstyle_topandbottom"></div> <b>Top and bottom</b> - the text is only above and below the image.</p></li>
				    <li><p><div class = "icon icon-wrappingstyle_infront"></div> <b>In front</b> - the image overlaps the text.</p></li>
				    <li><p><div class = "icon icon-wrappingstyle_behind"></div> <b>Behind</b> - the text overlaps the image.</p></li>
				    </ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you select the square, tight, through, or top and bottom style, you will be able to set up some additional parameters - <b>distance from text</b> at all sides (top, bottom, left, right).</p>
            <p id="position"><img alt="Image - Advanced Settings: Position" src="../images/image_properties_2.png" /></p>
            <p>The <b>Position</b> tab is available only if you select a wrapping style other than inline. This tab contains the following parameters that vary depending on the selected wrapping style:</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    The <b>Vertical</b> section allows you to select one of the following three image positioning types:
                    <ul>
