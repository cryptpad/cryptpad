Manually drag the handles to set the cropping area. You can move the mouse cursor over the cropping area border so that it turns into the <span class="icon icon-arrow"></span> icon and drag the area. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>To crop a single side, drag the handle located in the center of this side.</li>

                <li>If you select the <b>Fit</b> option, the image will be resized so that it fits the cropping area height or width. No parts of the original image will be removed, but empty spaces may appear within the selected cropping area.</li>
