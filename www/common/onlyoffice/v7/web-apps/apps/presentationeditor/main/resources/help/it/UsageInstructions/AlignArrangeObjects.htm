			<h1>Align and arrange objects on a slide</h1>
			<p>The added <b>autoshapes, images, charts</b> or <b>text boxes</b> can be aligned, grouped, ordered, distributed horizontally and vertically on a slide. To perform any of these actions, first select a separate object or several objects in the slide editing area. To select several objects, hold down the <b>Ctrl</b> key and left-click the necessary objects. To select a text box, click on its border, not the text within it. After that you can use either the icons at the <b>Home</b> tab of the top toolbar described below or the analogous options from the right-click menu.</p>
			
        <h3>Align objects</h3>
        <p>To <b>align</b> <em>two or more</em> selected objects, </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Click the <b>Align shape</b> <div class = "icon icon-alignshape"></div> icon at the <b>Home</b> tab of the top toolbar and select one of the following options:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Align to Slide</b> to align objects relative to the edges of the slide,</li>
                    <li><b>Align Selected Objects</b> (this option is selected by default) to align objects relative to each other,</li>                    
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Click the <b>Align shape</b> <div class = "icon icon-alignshape"></div> icon once again and select the necessary alignment type from the list:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Align Left</b> <div class = "icon icon-alignobjectleft"></div> - to line up the objects horizontally by the left edge of the leftmost object/left edge of the slide,</li>
                    <li><b>Align Center</b> <div class = "icon icon-alignobjectcenter"></div> - to line up the objects horizontally by their centers/center of the slide,</li>
                    <li><b>Align Right</b> <div class = "icon icon-alignobjectright"></div> - to line up the objects horizontally by the right edge of the rightmost object/right edge of the slide,</li>
                    <li><b>Align Top</b> <div class = "icon icon-alignobjecttop"></div> - to line up the objects vertically by the top edge of the topmost object/top edge of the slide,</li>
                    <li><b>Align Middle</b> <div class = "icon icon-alignobjectmiddle"></div> - to line up the objects vertically by their middles/middle of the slide,</li>
                    <li><b>Align Bottom</b> <div class = "icon icon-alignobjectbottom"></div>  - to line up the objects vertically by the bottom edge of the bottommost object/bottom edge of the slide.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Alternatively, you can right-click the selected objects, choose the <b>Align</b> option from the contextual menu and then use one of the available alignment options.</p>
        <p>If you want to align a single object, it can be aligned relative to the edges of the slide. The <b>Align to Slide</b> option is selected by default in this case.</p>
        <h3>Distribute objects</h3>
        <p>To <b>distribute</b> <em>three or more</em> selected objects horizontally or vertically so that the equal distance appears between them, </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Click the <b>Align shape</b> <div class = "icon icon-alignshape"></div> icon at the <b>Home</b> tab of the top toolbar and select one of the following options:
                <ul>                    
                    <li><b>Align to Slide</b> to distribute objects between the edges of the slide,</li>
                    <li><b>Align Selected Objects</b> (this option is selected by default) to distribute objects between two outermost selected objects,</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Click the <b>Align shape</b> <div class = "icon icon-alignshape"></div> icon once again and select the necessary distribution type from the list:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Distribute Horizontally</b> <div class = "icon icon-distributehorizontally"></div> - to distribute objects evenly between the leftmost and rightmost selected objects/left and right edges of the slide<!--to align the selected objects by their centers (from right to left edges) to the horizontal center of the page-->.</li>
                    <li><b>Distribute Vertically</b> <div class = "icon icon-distributevertically"></div> - to distribute objects evenly between the topmost and bottommost selected objects/top and bottom edges of the slide<!--to align the selected objects by their centers (from top to bottom edges) to the vertical center of the page-->.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Alternatively, you can right-click the selected objects, choose the <b>Align</b> option from the contextual menu and then use one of the available distribution options.</p>

        <h3>Group objects</h3>
        <p>To <b>group</b> <em>two or more</em> selected objects or <b>ungroup</b> them, click the <b>Arrange shape</b> <span class="icon icon-arrangeshape"></span> icon at the <b>Home</b> tab of the top toolbar and select the necessary option from the list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Group</b> <div class = "icon icon-group"></div> - to join several objects into a group so that they can be simultaneously rotated, moved, resized, aligned, arranged, copied, pasted, formatted like a single object.</li>
            <li><b>Ungroup</b> <div class = "icon icon-ungroup"></div> - to ungroup the selected group of the previously joined objects.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Alternatively, you can right-click the selected objects, choose the <b>Arrange</b> option from the contextual menu and then use the <b>Group</b> or <b>Ungroup</b> option.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: the <b>Group</b> option is disabled if you select less than two objects. The <b>Ungroup</b> option is available only when a group of the previously joined objects is selected.</p>
        <h3>Arrange objects</h3>
        <p>To <b>arrange</b> the selected object(s) (i.e. to change their order when several objects overlap each other), click the <b>Arrange shape</b> <span class="icon icon-arrangeshape"></span> icon at the <b>Home</b> tab of the top toolbar and select the necessary arrangement type from the list.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Bring To Foreground</b> <div class = "icon icon-bringtofront"></div> - to move the object(s) in front of all other objects,</li>
            <li><b>Send To Background</b> <div class = "icon icon-sendtoback"></div> - to move the object(s) behind all other objects,</li>
            <li><b>Bring Forward</b> <div class = "icon icon-bringforward"></div> - to move the selected object(s) by one level forward as related to other objects.</li>            
            <li><b>Send Backward</b> <div class = "icon icon-sendbackward"></div> - to move the selected object(s) by one level backward as related to other objects.</li>
        </ul>        
        <p>Alternatively, you can right-click the selected object(s), choose the <b>Arrange</b> option from the contextual menu and then use one of the available arrangement options.</p>
