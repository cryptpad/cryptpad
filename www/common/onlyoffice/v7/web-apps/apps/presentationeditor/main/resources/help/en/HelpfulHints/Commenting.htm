			<h1>Commenting</h1>
			<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.onlyoffice.com/presentation-editor.aspx" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)"><b>Presentation Editor</b></a> allows you to maintain constant team-wide approach to work flow: <a href="https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/userguides/groups-guides-documents-share-documents.aspx" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">share</a> files and folders, <a href="../HelpfulHints/CollaborativeEditing.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">collaborate</a> on presentations in real time, <a href="../HelpfulHints/UsingChat.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">communicate</a> right in the editor, save <a href="../HelpfulHints/VersionHistory.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">presentation versions</a> for future use.</p>
			<p>In <b>Presentation Editor</b> you can leave comments to the content of presentations without actually editing it. Unlike <a href="../HelpfulHints/UsingChat.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">chat messages</a>, the comments stay until deleted.</p>
			<h3>Leaving comments and replying to them</h3>
			<p>To leave a comment to a certain object (text box, shape etc.):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>select an object where you think there is an error or problem,</li>
				<li>
					switch to the <b>Insert</b> or <b>Collaboration</b> tab of the top toolbar and click the <div class="icon icon-comment_toptoolbar"></div> <b>Comment</b> button, or<br />
					right-click the selected object and select the <b>Add Сomment</b> option from the menu,<br />
				</li>
				<li>enter the needed text,</li>
				<li>click the <b>Add Comment/Add</b> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The object you commented will be marked with the <span class="icon icon-added_comment_icon"></span> icon. To view the comment, just click on this icon.</p>
			<p>To add a comment to a certain slide, select the slide and use the <span class="icon icon-comment_toptoolbar"></span> <b>Comment</b> button on the <b>Insert</b> or <b>Collaboration</b> tab of the top toolbar. The added comment will be displayed in the upper left corner of the slide.</p>
			<p>To create a presentation-level comment which is not related to a certain object or slide, click the <span class="icon icon-commentsicon"></span> icon on the left sidebar to open the <b>Comments</b> panel and use the <b>Add Comment to Document</b> link. The presentation-level comments can be viewed on the <b>Comments</b> panel. Comments related to objects and slides are also available here.</p>
			<p>Any other user can answer to the added comment asking questions or reporting on the work they have done. For this purpose, click the <b>Add Reply</b> link situated under the comment, type in your reply text in the entry field and press the <b>Reply</b> button.</p>
			<p>If you are using the <b>Strict</b> co-editing mode, new comments added by other users will become visible only after you click the <span class="icon icon-saveupdate"></span> icon in the left upper corner of the top toolbar.</p>
			<h3>Managing comments</h3>
			<p>You can manage the added comments using the icons in the comment balloon or on the <b>Comments</b> panel on the left:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					sort the added comments by clicking the <div class="icon icon-sortcommentsicon"></div> icon:
					<ul>
						<li>by date: <b>Newest</b> or <b>Oldest</b>.</li>
						<li>by author: <b>Author from A to Z</b> or <b>Author from Z to A</b>.</li>
						<li>
							by group: <b>All</b> or choose a certain group from the list. This sorting option is available if you are running a version that includes this functionality.
							<p><img alt="Sort comments" src="../images/sortcomments.png" /></p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>edit the currently selected by clicking the <div class="icon icon-editcommenticon"></div> icon,</li>
				<li>delete the currently selected by clicking the <div class="icon icon-deletecommenticon"></div> icon,</li>
				<li>close the currently selected discussion by clicking the <div class="icon icon-resolveicon"></div> icon if the task or problem you stated in your comment was solved, after that the discussion you opened with your comment gets the resolved status. To open it again, click the <div class="icon icon-resolvedicon"></div> icon,</li>
				<li>if you want to manage comments in a bunch, open the <b>Resolve</b> drop-down menu on the <b>Collaboration</b> tab. Select one of the options for resolving comments: <b>resolve current comments</b>, <b>resolve my comments</b> or <b>resolve all comments</b> in the presentation.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Adding mentions</h3>
			<p class="note">You can only add mentions to the comments made to the presentation content and not to the presentation itself.</p>
			<p>When entering comments, you can use the <b>mentions</b> feature that allows you to attract somebody's attention to the comment and send a notification to the mentioned user via email and <b>Talk</b>.</p>
			<p>To add a mention,</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Enter the "+" or "@" sign anywhere in the comment text - a list of the portal users will open. To simplify the search process, you can start typing a name in the comment field - the user list will change as you type.</li>
				<li>Select the necessary person from the list. If the file has not yet been shared with the mentioned user, the <b>Sharing Settings</b> window will open. <b>Read only</b> access type is selected by default. <a href="https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/userguides/groups-guides-documents-share-documents.aspx" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">Change it if necessary</a>.</li>
				<li>Click <b>OK</b>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The mentioned user will receive an email notification that they have been mentioned in a comment. If the file has been shared, the user will also receive a corresponding notification.</p>
			<h3>Removing comments</h3>
			<p>To remove comments,</p>
			<ol>
				<li>click the <div class="icon icon-removecomment_toptoolbar"></div> <b>Remove</b> button on the <b>Collaboration</b> tab of the top toolbar,</li>
				<li>
					select the necessary option from the menu:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Remove Current Comments</b> - to remove the currently selected comment. If some replies have been added to the comment, all its replies will be removed as well.</li>
						<li><b>Remove My Comments</b> - to remove comments you added without removing comments added by other users. If some replies have been added to your comment, all its replies will be removed as well.</li>
						<li><b>Remove All Comments</b> - to remove all the comments in the presentation that you and other users added.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
