				<li>click the <div class = "icon icon-insertautoshape"></div> <b>Shape</b> icon on the top toolbar,</li>
				<li>select one of the available autoshape groups from the <b>Shape Gallery</b>: <em>Recently Used</em>, <em>Basic Shapes</em>, <em>Figured Arrows</em>, <em>Math</em>, <em>Charts</em>, <em>Stars & Ribbons</em>, <em>Callouts</em>, <em>Buttons</em>, <em>Rectangles</em>, <em>Lines</em>,</li>
				<li>click the necessary autoshape within the selected group,</li>
				<li>place the mouse cursor where the shape sholud be added,</li>
				<li>once the autoshape is added, you can <a href="ManipulateObjects.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">change its size and position</a> as well as its settings.
			</ol>
			<h3>Adjust the autoshape settings</h3>
			<p>Some of the autoshape settings can be changed using the <b>Shape settings</b> tab on the right sidebar that will open if you select the inserted autoshape with the mouse and click the <b>Shape settings</b> <span class="icon icon-shape_settings_icon"></span>  icon. The following settings can be changed:</p>
			<ul>
			<li id="shape_fill"><b>Fill</b> - use this section to select the autoshape fill. You can choose the following options:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Color Fill</b> - select this option to specify a solid color to fill the inner space of the selected autoshape.
				<p><img alt="Color Fill" src="../images/fill_color.png" /></p>
				<p id="color">Click the colored box below and select the necessary color from the available color sets or specify any color you like:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Theme Colors</b> - the colors that correspond to the selected color scheme of the spreadsheet.</li>
						<li><b>Standard Colors</b> - the default colors set.</li>
						<li><b>Custom Color</b> - click this caption if there is no needed color in the available palettes. Select the necessary color range by moving the vertical color slider and set the specific color by dragging the color picker within the large square color field. Once you select a color with the color picker, the appropriate RGB and sRGB color values will be displayed in the fields on the right. You can also specify a color on the base of the RGB color model by entering the necessary numeric values into the <b>R</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>B</b> (red, green, blue) fields or enter the sRGB hexadecimal code into the field marked with the <b>#</b> sign. The selected color appears in the <b>New</b> preview box. If the object was previously filled with any custom color, this color is displayed in the <b>Current</b> box so you can compare the original and modified colors. When the color is specified, click the <b>Add</b> button. The custom color will be applied to your autoshape and added to the <b>Custom color</b> palette.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Gradient Fill</b> - use this option to fill the shape with two or more fading colors. Customize your gradient fill with no constraints. Click the <b>Shape settings</b> <div class = "icon icon-shape_settings_icon"></div> icon to open the <b>Fill</b> menu on the right sidebar:

            <ul>
                <li><b>Move and size with cells</b> - this option allows you to snap the shape to the cell behind it. If the cell moves (e.g. if you insert or delete some rows/columns), the shape will be moved together with the cell. If you increase or decrease the width or height of the cell, the shape will change its size as well.</li>
                <li><b>Move but don't size with cells</b> - this option allows you to snap the shape to the cell behind it preventing the shape from being resized. If the cell moves, the shape will be moved together with the cell, but if you change the cell size, the shape dimensions remain unchanged.</li>
                <li><b>Don't move or size with cells</b> - this option allows you to prevent the shape from being moved or resized if the cell position or size was changed.</li>
            </ul>

		    <hr />
			<h3>Insert and format text within the autoshape</h3>
			<p>To insert a text into the autoshape, select the shape with the mouse and start typing your text. The text will become part of the autoshape (when you move or rotate the shape, the text also moves or rotates with it).</p>
            <p>All the formatting options you can apply to the text within the autoshape are listed <a href="InsertTextObjects.htm#textbox_textformatting" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">here</a>.</p>
            <hr />
            <h3>Join autoshapes using connectors</h3>
            <p>You can connect autoshapes using lines with connection points to demonstrate dependencies between the objects (e.g. if you want to create a flowchart). To do that,</p>
            <ol>
                <li>click the <div class = "icon icon-insertautoshape"></div> <b>Shape</b> icon on the <b>Insert</b> tab of the top toolbar,</li>
                <li>select the <b>Lines</b> group from the menu,
                <p><img alt="Shapes - Lines" src="../images/connectors.png" /></p>
                </li>
                <li>click the necessary shape within the selected group (excepting the last three shapes which are not connectors, namely <em>Curve</em>, <em>Scribble</em> and <em>Freeform</em>),</li>
                <li>hover the mouse cursor over the first autoshape and click one of the connection points <div class = "icon icon-connectionpoint"></div> that appear on the shape outline,
                <p><span class="big big-connectors_firstshape"></span></p>
                </li>
                <li>drag the mouse cursor towards the second autoshape and click the necessary connection point on its outline.
                <p><span class="big big-connectors_secondshape"></span></p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you move the joined autoshapes, the connector remains attached to the shapes and moves together with them. </p>
            <p><span class="big big-connectors_moveshape"></span></p>
            <p>You can also detach the connector from the shapes and then attach it to any other connection points.</p>
			<h3>Assign a Macro to a Shape</h3>
            <p>You can provide a quick and easy access to a macro within a spreadsheet by assigning a macro to any shape. Once you assign a macro, the shape appears as a button control and you can run the macro whenever you click it.</p>
            <p>To assign a macro:</p>
            <ul type="circle">
                <li>
                    Right-click the shape to assign a macro to and choose the <b>Assign Macro</b> option from the drop-down menu.
