            <ol>
                <li>place the cursor where the image should be added,</li>
                <li>switch to the <b>Insert</b> tab of the top toolbar,</li>
                <li>click the <div class = "icon icon-image"></div> <b>Image</b> icon on the top toolbar,</li>
                <li>
                    select one of the following options to load the image:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the <b>Image from File</b> option will open the standard dialog window to select a file. Browse the hard disk drive of your computer to find the required file and click the <b>Open</b> button
                            <p class="note">In the <em>online editor</em>, you can select several images at once.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>the <b>Image from URL</b> option will open the window where you can enter the web address of the required image and click the <b>OK</b> button</li>
                        <li class="onlineDocumentFeatures"> the <b>Image from Storage</b> option will open the <b>Select data source</b> window. Select an image stored on your portal and click the <b>OK</b> button</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>After that the image will be added to the worksheet.</p>
            <h3>Adjust the image settings</h3>
            <p>Once the image is added, you can <a href="ManipulateObjects.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">change its size and position</a>.</p>
            <p>To specify the exact dimensions of the image:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>select the required image with the mouse,</li>
                <li>
                    click the <b>Image settings</b> <div class = "icon icon-image_settings_icon"></div> icon on the right sidebar,
                    <p><img alt="Image Settings Right-Side Panel window" src="../images/imagesettings.png" /></p>
                </li>
                <li>in the <b>Size</b> section, set the necessary <b>Width</b> and <b>Height</b> values. If the <b>Constant proportions</b> <div class = "icon icon-constantproportions"></div> button is clicked (in this case it looks like this <div class = "icon icon-constantproportionsactivated"></div>), the width and height will be changed together preserving the original image aspect ratio. To restore the actual size of the added image, click the <b>Actual Size</b> button.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>To crop the image:</p>
            <p>Click the <b>Crop</b> button to activate cropping handles which appear on the image corners and in the center of each side. Manually drag the handles to set the cropping area. You can move the mouse cursor over the cropping area border so that it turns into the Arrow <span class="icon icon-arrow"></span> icon and drag the area. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>To crop a single side, drag the handle located in the center of this side.</li>
                <li>To simultaneously crop two adjacent sides, drag one of the corner handles.</li>
                <li>To equally crop two opposite sides of the image, hold down the <em>Ctrl</em> key when dragging the handle in the center of one of these sides. </li>
                <li>To equally crop all sides of the image, hold down the <em>Ctrl</em> key when dragging any of the corner handles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When the cropping area is specified, click the <b>Crop</b> button once again, or press the <em>Esc</em> key, or click anywhere outside of the cropping area to apply the changes.</p>
            <p>After the cropping area is selected, it's also possible to use the <b>Crop to shape</b>, <b>Fill</b> and <b>Fit</b> options available from the <b>Crop</b> drop-down menu. Click the <b>Crop</b> button once again and select the option you need: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you select the <b>Crop to shape</b> option, the picture will fill a certain shape. You can select a shape from the gallery, which opens when you hover your mouse pointer over the <b>Crop to Shape</b> option. You can still use the <b>Fill</b> and <b>Fit</b> options to choose the way your picture matches the shape.</li>
                <li>If you select the <b>Fill</b> option, the central part of the original image will be preserved and used to fill the selected cropping area, while other parts of the image will be removed.</li>
                <li>If you select the <b>Fit</b> option, the image will be resized so that it fits the height or width of the cropping area. No parts of the original image will be removed, but empty spaces may appear within the selected cropping area.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To rotate the image:</p>
            <ol>

                <li>click the <b>Image settings</b> <div class = "icon icon-image_settings_icon"></div> icon on the right sidebar,</li>

                <li>
                    choose the necessary option: <b>From File</b>, <b>From Storage</b>, or <b>From URL</b> and select the desired image.
                    <p class="note">Alternatively, you can right-click the image and use the <b>Replace image</b> option from the contextual menu.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The selected image will be replaced.</p>
            <p>When the image is selected, the <b>Shape settings</b> <span class="icon icon-shape_settings_icon"></span> icon is also available on the right. You can click this icon to open the <b>Shape settings</b> tab on the right sidebar and adjust the shape <a href="../UsageInstructions/InsertAutoshapes.htm#shape_stroke" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)"><b>Line</b></a> type, its size and color as well as change the shape type by selecting another shape from the <b>Change Autoshape</b> menu. The shape of the image will change correspondingly.</p>

            <p><img alt="Image - Advanced Settings: Rotation" src="../images/imageadvancedsettings1.png" /></p>
            <p>The <b>Rotation</b> tab contains the following parameters:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Angle</b> - use this option to rotate the image by an exactly specified angle. Enter the necessary value measured in degrees into the field or adjust it using the arrows on the right. </li>
                <li><b>Flipped</b> - check the <b>Horizontally</b> box to flip the image horizontally (left to right) or check the <b>Vertically</b> box to flip the image vertically (upside down).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><img alt="Image - Advanced Settings: Cell Snapping" src="../images/imageadvancedsettings2.png" /></p>
            <p>The <b>Cell Snapping</b> tab contains the following parameters:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Move and size with cells</b> - this option allows you to snap the image to the cell behind it. If the cell moves (e.g. if you insert or delete some rows/columns), the image will be moved together with the cell. If you increase or decrease the width or height of the cell, the image will change its size as well.</li>
                <li><b>Move but don't size with cells</b> - this option allows you to snap the image to the cell behind it preventing the image from being resized. If the cell moves, the image will be moved together with the cell, but if you change the cell size, the image dimensions remain unchanged.</li>
                <li><b>Don't move or size with cells</b> - this option allows you to prevent the image from being moved or resized if the cell position or size was changed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><img alt="Image - Advanced Settings: Alternative Text" src="../images/imageadvancedsettings.png" /></p>
            <p>The <b>Alternative Text</b> tab allows you to specify the <b>Title</b> and the <b>Description</b> which will be read to people with vision or cognitive impairments to help them better understand what information the image contains.</p>
            <p>To delete the inserted image, click it and press the <b>Delete</b> key.</p>
            <h3>Assign a Macro to an Image</h3>
            <p>You can provide a quick and easy access to a macro within a spreadsheet by assigning a macro to any image. Once you assign a macro, the image appears as a button control and you can run the macro whenever you click it.</p>
