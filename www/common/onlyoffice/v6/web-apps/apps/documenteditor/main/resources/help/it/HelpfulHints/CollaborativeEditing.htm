        <h1>Collaborative Document Editing</h1>
        <p><b>Document Editor</b> offers you the possibility to work at a document collaboratively with other users. This feature includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="onlineDocumentFeatures">simultaneous multi-user access to the edited document</li>
            <li class="onlineDocumentFeatures">visual indication of passages that are being edited by other users</li>
            <li class="onlineDocumentFeatures">real-time changes display or synchronization of changes with one button click</li>
            <li class="onlineDocumentFeatures">chat to share ideas concerning particular document parts</li>
            <li>comments containing the description of a task or problem that should be solved (it's also possible to work with comments in the offline mode, without connecting to the <em>online version</em>)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="desktopDocumentFeatures">
            <h3>Connecting to the online version</h3>
            <p>In the <em>desktop editor</em>, open the <b>Connect to cloud</b> option of the left-side menu in the main program window. Connect to your cloud office specifying your account login and password. <!--В окне ввода логина и пароля также доступна ссылка для регистрации в Облаке.--></p>
        </div>
        <div class="onlineDocumentFeatures">
        <h3>Co-editing</h3>
        <p><b>Document Editor</b> allows to select one of the two available co-editing modes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Fast</b> is used by default and shows the changes made by other users in real time.</li>
            <li><b>Strict</b> is selected to hide other user changes until you click the <b>Save</b> <img alt="Save icon" src="../images/saveupdate.png" /> icon to save your own changes and accept the changes made by others.</li>
        </ul>
            <p>The mode can be selected in the <a href="../HelpfulHints/AdvancedSettings.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">Advanced Settings</a>. It's also possible to choose the necessary mode using the <img alt="Co-editing Mode icon" src="../images/coeditingmode.png" /> <b>Co-editing Mode</b> icon at the <b>Collaboration</b> tab of the top toolbar:</p>
            <p><img alt="Co-editing Mode menu" src="../images/coeditingmodemenu.png" /></p>
            <p class="note">
                <b>Note</b>: when you co-edit a document in the <b>Fast</b> mode, the possibility to <b>Redo</b> the last undone operation is not available.
            </p>
        <p>When a document is being edited by several users simultaneously in the <b>Strict</b> mode, the edited text passages are marked with dashed lines of different colors. By hovering the mouse cursor over one of the edited passages, the name of the user who is editing it at the moment is displayed. The <b>Fast</b> mode will show the actions and the names of the co-editors once they are editing the text.</p>
        <p>The number of users who are working at the current document is specified on the right side of the editor header - <img alt="Number of users icon" src="../images/usersnumber.png" />. If you want to see who exactly are editing the file now, you can click this icon or open the <b>Chat</b> panel with the full list of the users.</p>
        <p>When no users are viewing or editing the file, the icon in the editor header will look like <img alt="Manage document access rights icon" src="../images/access_rights.png" /> allowing you to manage the users who have access to the file right from the document: invite new users giving them permissions to <em>edit</em>, <em>read</em>, <em>comment</em>, <em>fill forms</em> or <em>review</em> the document, or <em>deny</em> some users access rights to the file. Click this icon to manage the access to the file; this can be done both when there are no other users who view or co-edit the document at the moment and when there are other users and the icon looks like <img alt="Number of users icon" src="../images/usersnumber.png" />. It's also possible to set access rights using the <img alt="Sharing icon" src="../images/sharingicon.png" /> <b>Sharing</b> icon at the <b>Collaboration</b> tab of the top toolbar.</p>
        <p>As soon as one of the users saves his/her changes by clicking the <img alt="Save icon" src="../images/savewhilecoediting.png" /> icon, the others will see a note within the status bar stating that they have updates. To save the changes you made, so that other users can view them, and get the updates saved by your co-editors, click the <img alt="Save icon" src="../images/saveupdate.png" /> icon in the left upper corner of the top toolbar. The updates will be highlighted for you to check what exactly has been changed.</p>
        <p>You can specify what changes you want to be highlighted during co-editing if you click the <b>File</b> tab at the top toolbar, select the <b>Advanced Settings...</b> option and choose between <b>none</b>, <b>all</b> and <b>last</b> real-time collaboration changes. Selecting <b>View all</b> changes, all the changes made during the current session will be highlighted. Selecting <b>View last</b> changes, only the changes made since you last time clicked the <img alt="Save icon" src="../images/saveupdate.png" /> icon will be highlighted. Selecting <b>View None</b> changes, changes made during the current session will not be highlighted.</p>
        <h3 id="chat">Chat</h3>
        <p>You can use this tool to coordinate the co-editing process on-the-fly, for example, to arrange with your collaborators about who is doing what, which paragraph you are going to edit now etc.</p>
        <p>The chat messages are stored during one session only. To discuss the document content it is better to use comments which are stored until you decide to delete them.</p>
        <p>To access the chat and leave a message for other users,</p>
        <ol>
            <li>click the <img alt="Chat icon" src="../images/chaticon.png" /> icon at the left sidebar, or <br />
