			<h1>Manage sheets</h1>
			<p>By default, a newly created spreadsheet has a single sheet. The simplest way to add a new sheet into the <a href="https://www.onlyoffice.com/spreadsheet-editor.aspx" target="_blank" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)"><b>Spreadsheet Editor</b></a> is to click the Plus <span class="icon icon-plus"></span> button located to the right of the <b>Sheet Navigation</b> buttons in the left lower corner.</p>
			<p>Another way to <b>add a new sheet</b> is to:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>right-click the sheet tab after which you wish to insert a new one,</li>
			<li>select the <b>Insert</b> option from the right-click menu.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>A new sheet will be inserted after the selected one.</p>
			<p><b>To activate the required sheet</b>, use the sheet tabs in the left lower corner of each spreadsheet.</p>
			<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: if you have a lot of sheets, you can find the necessary one by using the <b>Sheet Navigation</b> buttons situated in the left lower corner.</p>
			<p><b>To delete an unnecessary sheet:</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li>right-click the sheet tab you wish to delete,</li>
				<li>select the <b>Delete</b> option from the right-click menu.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The selected sheet will be deleted from the current spreadsheet.</p>
			<p><b>To rename an existing sheet:</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li>right-click the sheet tab you wish to rename,</li>
				<li>select the <b>Rename</b> option from the right-click menu,</li>
				<li>enter the <b>Sheet Name</b> in the dialog box and click <b>OK</b>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The selected sheet name will be changed.</p>
			<p><b>To copy an existing sheet:</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li>right-click the sheet tab you wish to copy,</li>
				<li>select the <b>Copy</b> option from the right-click menu,</li>
				<li>select the sheet before which you wish to insert the copied one or use the <b>Copy to end</b> option to insert the copied sheet after all the existing ones,</li>
				<li>
					click the <b>OK</b> button to confirm your choice.
					<p>or</p>
					<p>press and hold down the <b>CTRL</b> key and drag the sheet tab to the right to duplicate it and move the copy to the location you need.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The selected sheet will be copied and inserted in the selected place.</p>
			<p><b>To move an existing sheet:</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li>right-click the sheet tab you wish to move,</li>
				<li>select the <b>Move</b> option from the right-click menu,</li>
				<li>select the sheet before which you wish to insert the selected one or use the <b>Move to end</b> option to move the selected sheet after all the existing ones,</li>
				<li>click the <b>OK</b> button to confirm your choice.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Or simply <b>drag</b> the necessary sheet tab and <b>drop</b> it to a new location. The selected sheet will be moved.</p>
			<p>You can also manually <b>drag'n'drop</b> a sheet from one book to another. To do this, select the sheet you want to move and drag it to the sheet bar of another book. For example, you can drag a sheet from the online editor book to the desktop one:</p>
			<p><img alt="Move sheet gif" src="../images/move_sheet.gif" /></p>
			<p>In this case, the sheet from the original spreadsheet will be <b>deleted</b>.</p>
            <p class="note">Currently, it's not possible to drag'n'drop sheets to a new workbook in Desktop Editors on Linux.</p>
			<p>If you have a lot of sheets, you can hide some of them you don't need to facilitate your work. To do that,</p>
			<ol>
				<li>right-click the sheet tab you wish to hide,</li>
				<li>select the <b>Hide</b> option from the right-click menu,</li>
			</ol>
			<p><b>To display the hidden sheet tab</b>, right-click any sheet tab, open the <b>Hidden</b> list and select the sheet tab you wish to display.</p>
			<p>To differentiate the sheets, you can <b>assign different colors to the sheet tabs</b>. To do that,</p>
			<ol>
				<li>right-click the sheet tab you wish to color,</li>
                <li>select the <b>Tab Color</b> option from the right-click menu,</li>
				<li>select any color in the available palettes
					<p><img alt="Palette" src="../images/palette.png" /></p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Theme Colors</b> - the colors that correspond to the selected color scheme of the spreadsheet.</li>
						<li><b>Standard Colors</b> - the default colors set.</li>
						<li><b>Custom Color</b> - click this caption if there is no needed color in the available palettes. Select the necessary color range moving the vertical color slider and set the specific color by dragging the color picker within the large square color field. Once you select a color with the color picker, the appropriate RGB and sRGB color values will be displayed in the fields on the right. You can also specify a color on the base of the RGB color model by entering the necessary numeric values into the <b>R</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>B</b> (red, green, blue) fields or enter the sRGB hexadecimal code into the field marked with the <b>#</b> sign. The selected color will appear in the <b>New</b> preview box. If the object was previously filled with any custom color, this color is displayed in the <b>Current</b> box, so you can compare the original and modified colors. When the color is specified, click the <b>Add</b> button:
						<p><img alt="Palette - Custom Color" src="../../../../../../common/main/resources/help/en/images/palette_custom.png" /></p>
						<p>The custom color will be applied to the selected tab and added to the <b>Custom color</b> palette.</p>
						</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You can <b>work with multiple sheets simultaneously</b>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>select the first sheet you want to include into the group,</li>
				<li>press and hold the <em>Shift</em> key to select several adjacent sheets you want to group, or use the <em>Ctrl</em> key to select several non-adjacent sheets you want to group,</li>
				<li>right-click one of the selected sheets tab to open the contextual menu,</li>
				<li>choose the necessary option from the menu: 
				<p><img alt="Manage multiple sheets" src="../images/severalsheets.png" /></p>
				<ul>					
					<li><b>Insert</b> - to insert the same number of new blank sheets, as in the selected group,</li>
					<li><b>Delete</b> - to delete all the selected sheets at once (you cannot delete all sheets in the workbook, as the workbook must contain at least one visible sheet),</li>
