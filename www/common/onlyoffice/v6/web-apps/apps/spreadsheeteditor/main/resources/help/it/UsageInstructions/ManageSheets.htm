			<h1>Manage sheets</h1>
			<p>By default a newly created spreadsheet has a single sheet. The most simple way to add a new one is to click the <img alt="Plus button" src="../images/plus.png" /> button located to the right of the <b>Sheet Navigation</b> buttons in the left lower corner.</p>
			<p>Another way to <b>add a new sheet</b> is to:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>right-click the sheet tab after which you wish to insert a new one,</li>
			<li>select the <b>Insert</b> option from the right-click menu.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>A new sheet will be inserted after the selected one.</p>
			<p><b>To activate the necessary sheet</b> use the sheet tabs in the left lower corner of each spreadsheet.</p>
			<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: if you have a lot of sheets to find the necessary one make use of the <b>Sheet Navigation</b> buttons situated in the left lower corner.</p>
