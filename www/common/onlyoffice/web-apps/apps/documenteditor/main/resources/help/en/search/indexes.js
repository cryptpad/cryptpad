To insert a formula into a table cell, place the cursor within the cell where you want to display the result, click the Add formula button at the right sidebar, in the Formula Settings window that opens, enter the necessary formula into the Formula field. You can enter a needed formula manually using the common mathematical operators (+, -, *, /), e.g. =A1*B2 or use the Paste Function drop-down list to select one of the embedded functions, e.g. =PRODUCT(A1,B2). manually specify necessary arguments within the parentheses in the Formula field. If the function requires several arguments, they must be separated by commas. use the Number Format drop-down list if you want to display the result in a certain number format, click OK. The result will be displayed in the selected cell. To edit the added formula, select the result in the cell and click the Add formula button at the right sidebar, make the necessary changes in the Formula Settings window and click OK. Add references to cells You can use the following arguments to quickly add references to cell ranges: ABOVE - a reference to all the cells in the column above the selected cell LEFT - a reference to all the cells in the row to the left of the selected cell BELOW - a reference to all the cells in the column below the selected cell RIGHT - a reference to all the cells in the row to the right of the selected cell These arguments can be used with the AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, MIN, PRODUCT, SUM functions. You can also manually enter references to a certain cell (e.g., A1) or a range of cells (e.g., A1:B3). Use bookmarks If you have added some bookmarks to certain cells within your table, you can use these bookmarks as arguments when entering formulas. In the Formula Settings window, place the cursor within the parentheses in the Formula entry field where you want the argument to be added and use the Paste Bookmark drop-down list to select one of the previously added bookmarks. Update formula results If you change some values in the table cells, you will need to manually update formula results: To update a single formula result, select the necessary result and press F9 or right-click the result and use the Update field option from the menu. To update several formula results, select the necessary cells or the entire table and press F9. Embedded functions You can use the following standard math, statistical and logical functions: Category Function Description Example Mathematical ABS(x) The function is used to return the absolute value of a number. =ABS(-10) Returns 10 Logical AND(logical1, logical2, ...) The function is used to check if the logical value you enter is TRUE or FALSE. The function returns 1 (TRUE) if all the arguments are TRUE. =AND(1&gt;0,1&gt;3) Returns 0 Statistical AVERAGE(argument-list) The function is used to analyze the range of data and find the average value. =AVERAGE(4,10) Returns 7 Statistical COUNT(argument-list) The function is used to count the number of the selected cells which contain numbers ignoring empty cells or those contaning text. =COUNT(A1:B3) Returns 6 Logical DEFINED() The function evaluates if a value in the cell is defined. The function returns 1 if the value is defined and calculated without errors and returns 0 if the value is not defined or calculated with an error. =DEFINED(A1) Logical FALSE() The function returns 0 (FALSE) and does not require any argument. =FALSE Returns 0 Mathematical INT(x) The function is used to analyze and return the integer part of the specified number. =INT(2.5) Returns 2 Statistical MAX(number1, number2, ...) The function is used to analyze the range of data and find the largest number. =MAX(15,18,6) Returns 18 Statistical MIN(number1, number2, ...) The function is used to analyze the range of data and find the smallest number. =MIN(15,18,6) Returns 6 Mathematical MOD(x, y) The function is used to return the remainder after the division of a number by the specified divisor. =MOD(6,3) Returns 0 Logical NOT(logical) The function is used to check if the logical value you enter is TRUE or FALSE. The function returns 1 (TRUE) if the argument is FALSE and 0 (FALSE) if the argument is TRUE. =NOT(2&lt;5) Returns 0 Logical OR(logical1, logical2, ...) The function is used to check if the logical value you enter is TRUE or FALSE. The function returns 0 (FALSE) if all the arguments are FALSE. =OR(1&gt;0,1&gt;3) Returns 1 Mathematical PRODUCT(argument-list) The function is used to multiply all the numbers in the selected range of cells and return the product. =PRODUCT(2,5) Returns 10 Mathematical ROUND(x, num_digits) The function is used to round the number to the desired number of digits. =ROUND(2.25,1) Returns 2.3 Mathematical SIGN(x) The function is used to return the sign of a number. If the number is positive, the function returns 1. If the number is negative, the function returns -1. If the number is 0, the function returns 0. =SIGN(-12) Returns -1 Mathematical SUM(argument-list) The function is used to add all the numbers in the selected range of cells and return the result. =SUM(5,3,2) Returns 10 Logical TRUE() The function returns 1 (TRUE) and does not require any argument. =TRUE Returns 1"

        "body": "A table of contents contains a list of all chapters (sections etc.) in a document and displays the numbers of the pages where each chapter is started. This allows to easily navigate through a multi-page document quickly switching to the necessary part of the text. The table of contents is generated automatically on the base of the document headings formatted using built-in styles. This makes it easy to update the created table of contents without the necessity to edit headings and change page numbers manually if the document text has been changed. Define the heading structure Format headings First of all, format headings in you document using one of the predefined styles. To do that, Select the text you want to include into the table of contents. Open the style menu on the right side of the Home tab at the top toolbar. Click the style you want to apply. By default, you can use the Heading 1 - Heading 9 styles. Note: if you want to use other styles (e.g. Title, Subtitle etc.) to format headings that will be included into the table of contents, you will need to adjust the table of contents settings first (see the corresponding section below). To learn more about available formatting styles, you can refer to this page. Manage headings Once the headings are formatted, you can click the Navigation icon at the left sidebar to open the panel that displays the list of all headings with corresponding nesting levels. This panel allows to easily navigate between headings in the document text as well as manage the heading structure. Right-click on a heading in the list and use one of the available options from the menu: Promote - to move the currently selected heading up to the higher level in the hierarchical structure, e.g. change it from Heading 2 to Heading 1. Demote - to move the currently selected heading down to the lower level in the hierarchical structure, e.g. change it from Heading 1 to Heading 2. New heading before - to add a new empty heading of the same level before the currently selected one. New heading after - to add a new empty heading of the same level after the currently selected one. New subheading - to add a new empty subheading (i.e. a heading with lower level) after the currently selected heading. When the heading or subheading is added, click on the added empty heading in the list and type in your own text. This can be done both in the document text and on the Navigation panel itself. Select content - to select the text below the current heading in the document (including the text related to all subheadings of this heading). Expand all - to expand all levels of headings at the Navigation panel. Collapse all - to collapse all levels of headings, excepting level 1, at the Navigation panel. Expand to level - to expand the heading structure to the selected level. E.g. if you select level 3, then levels 1, 2 and 3 will be expanded, while level 4 and all lower levels will be collapsed. To manually expand or collapse separate heading levels, use the arrows to the left of the headings. To close the Navigation panel, click the Navigation icon at the left sidebar once again. Insert a Table of Contents into the document To insert a table of contents into your document: Position the insertion point where you want to add the table of contents. Switch to the References tab of the top toolbar. Click the Table of Contents icon at the top toolbar, or click the arrow next to this icon and select the necessary layout option from the menu. You can select the table of contents that displays headings, page numbers and leaders, or headings only. Note: the table of content appearance can be adjusted later via the table of contents settings. The table of contents will be added at the current cursor position. To change the position of the table of contents, you can select the table of contents field (content control) and simply drag it to the desired place.

The Text Wrapping tab contains the following parameters: Wrapping Style - use this option to change the way the chart is positioned relative to the text: it will either be a part of the text (in case you select the inline style) or bypassed by it from all sides (if you select one of the other styles). Inline - the chart is considered to be a part of the text, like a character, so when the text moves, the chart moves as well. In this case the positioning options are inaccessible. If one of the following styles is selected, the chart can be moved independently of the text and positioned on the page exactly: Square - the text wraps the rectangular box that bounds the chart. Tight - the text wraps the actual chart edges. Through - the text wraps around the chart edges and fills in the open white space within the chart. Top and bottom - the text is only above and below the chart. In front - the chart overlaps the text. Behind - the text overlaps the chart. If you select the square, tight, through, or top and bottom style you will be able to set up some additional parameters - distance from text at all sides (top, bottom, left, right). The Position tab is available only if you select a wrapping style other than inline. This tab contains the following parameters that vary depending on the selected wrapping style: The Horizontal section allows you to select one of the following three chart positioning types: Alignment (left, center, right) relative to character, column, left margin, margin, page or right margin, Absolute Position measured in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified at the File -> Advanced Settings... tab) to the right of character, column, left margin, margin, page or right margin, Relative position measured in percent relative to the left margin, margin, page or right margin. The Vertical section allows you to select one of the following three chart positioning types: Alignment (top, center, bottom) relative to line, margin, bottom margin, paragraph, page or top margin, Absolute Position measured in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified at the File -> Advanced Settings... tab) below line, margin, bottom margin, paragraph, page or top margin, Relative position measured in percent relative to the margin, bottom margin, page or top margin. Move object with text controls whether the chart moves as the text to which it is anchored moves. Allow overlap controls whether two charts overlap or not if you drag them near each other on the page. The Alternative Text tab allows to specify a Title and Description which will be read to the people with vision or cognitive impairments to help them better understand what information there is in the chart."

It's also possible to open the history of versions using the Version History icon at the Collaboration tab of the top toolbar. You'll see the list of this document versions (major changes) and revisions (minor changes) with the indication of each version/revision author and creation date and time. For document versions, the version number is also specified (e.g. ver. 2). To know exactly which changes have been made in each separate version/revision, you can view the one you need by clicking it at the left sidebar. The changes made by the version/revision author are marked with the color which is displayed next to the author name on the left sidebar. You can use the Restore link below the selected version/revision to restore it. To return to the document current version, use the Close History option on the top of the version list.
