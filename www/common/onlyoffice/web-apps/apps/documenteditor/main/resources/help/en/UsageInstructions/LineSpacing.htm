			<h1>Set paragraph line spacing</h1>
			<p>In Document Editor, you can set the line height for the text lines within the paragraph as well as the margins between the current and the preceding or the subsequent paragraph.</p>
			<p>To do that,</p>
			<ol>
				<li>put the cursor within the paragraph you need, or select several paragraphs with the mouse or all the text in the document by pressing the <b>Ctrl+A</b> key combination,</li>
				<li>use the corresponding fields at the right sidebar to achieve the desired results:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Line Spacing</b> - set the line height for the text lines within the paragraph. You can select among three options: <b>at least</b> (sets the minimum line spacing that is needed to fit the largest font or graphic on the line), <b>multiple</b> (sets line spacing that can be expressed in numbers greater than 1), <b>exactly</b> (sets fixed line spacing). You can specify the necessary value in the field on the right.</li>
						<li><b>Paragraph Spacing</b> - set the amount of space between paragraphs.
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Before</b> - set the amount of space before the paragraph.</li>
                                <li><b>After</b> - set the amount of space after the paragraph.</li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Don't add interval between paragraphs of the same style</b> - check this box in case you don't need any space between paragraphs of the same style.
                                    <p><img alt="Right Sidebar - Paragraph Settings" src="../images/right_paragraph.png" /></p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>                        
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To quickly change the current paragraph line spacing, you can also use the <b>Paragraph Line Spacing</b> <img alt="Paragraph Line Spacing" src="../images/linespacing.png" /> icon at the top toolbar selecting the needed value from the list: 1.0, 1.15, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, or 3.0 lines.</p>
