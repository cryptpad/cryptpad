Values in reverse order - is used to display values in an opposite direction. When the box is unchecked, the lowest value is at the bottom and the highest value is at the top of the axis. When the box is checked, the values are ordered from top to bottom. The Tick Options section allows to adjust the appearance of tick marks on the vertical scale. Major tick marks are the larger scale divisions which can have labels displaying numeric values. Minor tick marks are the scale subdivisions which are placed between the major tick marks and have no labels. Tick marks also define where gridlines can be displayed, if the corresponding option is set at the Layout tab. The Major/Minor Type drop-down lists contain the following placement options: None to not display major/minor tick marks, Cross to display major/minor tick marks on both sides of the axis, In to display major/minor tick marks inside the axis, Out to display major/minor tick marks outside the axis. The Label Options section allows to adjust the appearance of major tick mark labels which display values. To specify a Label Position in regard to the vertical axis, select the necessary option from the drop-down list: None to not display tick mark labels, Low to display tick mark labels to the left of the plot area, High to display tick mark labels to the right of the plot area, Next to axis to display tick mark labels next to the axis. The Horizontal Axis tab allows you to change the parameters of the horizontal axis also referred to as the categories axis or x-axis which displays text labels. Note that the horizontal axis will be the value axis which displays numeric values for the Bar charts, therefore in this case the Horizontal Axis tab options will correspond to the ones described in the previous section. For the XY (Scatter) charts, both axes are value axes. The Axis Options section allows to set the following parameters: Axis Crosses - is used to specify a point on the horizontal axis where the vertical axis should cross it. The Auto option is selected by default, in this case the axes intersection point value is calculated automatically depending on the selected data range. You can select the Value option from the drop-down list and specify a different value in the entry field on the right, or set the axes intersection point at the Minimum/Maximum Value (that corresponds to the first and last category) on the horizontal axis. Axis Position - is used to specify where the axis text labels should be placed: On Tick Marks or Between Tick Marks. Values in reverse order - is used to display categories in an opposite direction. When the box is unchecked, categories are displayed from left to right. When the box is checked, the categories are ordered from right to left. The Tick Options section allows to adjust the appearance of tick marks on the horizontal scale. Major tick marks are the larger divisions which can have labels displaying category values. Minor tick marks are the smaller divisions which are placed between the major tick marks and have no labels. Tick marks also define where gridlines can be displayed, if the corresponding option is set at the Layout tab. You can adjust the following tick mark parameters: Major/Minor Type - is used to specify the following placement options: None to not display major/minor tick marks, Cross to display major/minor tick marks on both sides of the axis, In to display major/minor tick marks inside the axis, Out to display major/minor tick marks outside the axis. Interval between Marks - is used to specify how many categories should be displayed between two adjacent tick marks. The Label Options section allows to adjust the appearance of labels which display categories. Label Position - is used to specify where the labels should be placed in regard to the horizontal axis. Select the necessary option from the drop-down list: None to not display category labels, Low to display category labels at the bottom of the plot area, High to display category labels at the top of the plot area, Next to axis to display category labels next to the axis. Axis Label Distance - is used to specify how closely the labels should be placed to the axis. You can specify the necessary value in the entry field. The more the value you set, the more the distance between the axis and labels is. Interval between Labels - is used to specify how often the labels should be displayed. The Auto option is selected by default, in this case labels are displayed for every category. You can select the Manual option from the drop-down list and specify the necessary value in the entry field on the right. For example, enter 2 to display labels for every other category etc. The Alternative Text tab allows to specify a Title and Description which will be read to the people with vision or cognitive impairments to help them better understand what information there is in the chart. once the chart is added you can also change its size and position. You can specify the chart position on the slide dragging it vertically or horizontally.

Add a new equation To insert an equation from the gallery, switch to the Insert tab of the top toolbar, click the arrow next to the Equation icon at the top toolbar, in the opened drop-down list select the equation category you need. The following categories are currently available: Symbols, Fractions, Scripts, Radicals, Integrals, Large Operators, Brackets, Functions, Accents, Limits and Logarithms, Operators, Matrices, click the certain symbol/equation in the corresponding set of templates. The selected symbol/equation box will be inserted in the center of the current slide. If you do not see the equation box border, click anywhere within the equation - the border will be displayed as a dashed line. The equation box can be freely moved, resized or rotated on the slide. To do that click on the equation box border (it will be displayed as a solid line) and use corresponding handles. Each equation template represents a set of slots. Slot is a position for each element that makes up the equation. An empty slot (also called as a placeholder) has a dotted outline . You need to fill in all the placeholders specifying the necessary values. Enter values The insertion point specifies where the next character you enter will appear. To position the insertion point precisely, click within a placeholder and use the keyboard arrows to move the insertion point by one character left/right. Once the insertion point is positioned, you can fill in the placeholder: enter the desired numeric/literal value using the keyboard, insert a special character using the Symbols palette from the Equation menu at the Insert tab of the top toolbar, add another equation template from the palette to create a complex nested equation. The size of the primary equation will be automatically adjusted to fit its content. The size of the nested equation elements depends on the primary equation placeholder size, but it cannot be smaller than the sub-subscript size. To add some new equation elements you can also use the right-click menu options: To add a new argument that goes before or after the existing one within Brackets, you can right-click on the existing argument and select the Insert argument before/after option from the menu.

To do that just put the cursor within the placeholder and type in your text or paste it using the Ctrl+V key combination in place of the according default text. Add a text passage anywhere on a slide. You can insert a text box (a rectangular frame that allows to enter text within it) or a Text Art object (a text box with a predefined font style and color that allows to apply some text effects). Depending on the necessary text object type you can do the following: to add a text box, click the Text Box icon at the Home or Insert tab of the top toolbar, then click where you want to insert the text box, hold the mouse button and drag the text box border to specify its size. When you release the mouse button, the insertion point will appear in the added text box, allowing you to enter your text.

Some font formatting options (font type, size, color and decoration styles) can be applied to a previously selected portion of the text separately. Align your text within the text box The text is aligned horizontally in four ways: left, right, center or justified. To do that: place the cursor to the position where you want the alignment to be applied (this can be a new line or already entered text), drop-down the Horizontal align list at the Home tab of the top toolbar, select the alignment type you would like to apply: the Align text left option allows you to line up your text by the left side of the text box (the right side remains unaligned). the Align text center option allows you to line up your text by the center of the text box (the right and the left sides remains unaligned). the Align text right option allows you to line up your text by the right side of the text box (the left side remains unaligned). the Justify option allows you to line up your text by both the left and the right sides of the text box (additional spacing is added where necessary to keep the alignment). The text is aligned vertically in three ways: top, middle or bottom. To do that: place the cursor to the position where you want the alignment to be applied (this can be a new line or already entered text), drop-down the Vertical align list at the Home tab of the top toolbar, select the alignment type you would like to apply: the Align text to the top option allows you to line up your text by the top of the text box. the Align text to the middle option allows you to line up your text by the center of the text box. the Align text to the bottom option allows you to line up your text by the bottom of the text box. Change the text direction To Rotate the text within the text box, right-click the text, select the Text Direction option and then choose one of the available options: Horizontal (is selected by default), Rotate Text Down (sets a vertical direction, from top to bottom) or Rotate Text Up (sets a vertical direction, from bottom to top). Adjust font type, size, color and apply decoration styles You can select the font type, its size and color as well as apply various font decoration styles using the corresponding icons situated at the Home tab of the top toolbar.
