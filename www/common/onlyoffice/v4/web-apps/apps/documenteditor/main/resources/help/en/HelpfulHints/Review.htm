        <h1>Document Review</h1>
        <p>When somebody shares a file with you using the review permissions, you need to apply the document <b>Review</b> feature.</p>
        <p>As a reviewer, you can use the Review option to review the document, change the sentences, phrases and other page elements, correct spelling, etc. without actually editing it. All your changes will be recorded and shown to the person who sent you the document.</p>
        <p>If you send the file for review, you will need to display all the changes which were made to it, view and either accept or reject them.</p>
        <h3>Enable the Track Changes feature</h3>
        <p>To see changes suggested by a reviewer, enable the <b>Track Changes</b> option in one of the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>click the <img alt="Track changes button" src="../images/trackchangesstatusbar.png" /> button in the right lower corner on the status bar, or</li>
            <li>switch to the <b>Collaboration</b> tab on the top toolbar and press the <img alt="Track Changes button" src="../images/trackchangestoptoolbar.png" /> <b>Track Changes</b> button.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: it is not necessary for the reviewer to enable the <b>Track Changes</b> option. It is enabled by default and cannot be disabled when the document is shared with review only access rights.</p>
        <h3>View changes</h3>
        <p>Changes made by a user are highlighted with a specific color in the document text. When you click on the changed text, a pop-up window opens which displays the user name, the date and time when the change has been made, and the change description. The pop-up window also contains icons used to accept or reject the current change.</p>
        <p><img alt="Pop-up window" src="../images/review_popup.png" /></p>
        <p>If you drag and drop a piece of text to some other place in the document, the text in a new position will be underlined with the double line. The text in the original position will be double-crossed. This will count as a single change.</p>
        <p>Click the double-crossed text in the original position and use the <img alt="Follow Move button" src="../images/follow_move.png" /> arrow in the change pop-up window to go to the new location of the text.</p>
        <p>Click the double-underlined text in the new position and use the <img alt="Follow Move button" src="../images/follow_move.png" /> arrow in the change pop-up window to go to to the original location of the text.</p>
        <h3 id="displaymode">Choose the changes display mode</h3>
        <p>Click the <img alt="Display Mode button" src="../images/review_displaymode.png" /> <b>Display Mode</b> button on the top toolbar and select one of the available modes from the list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Markup</b> - this option is selected by default. It allows both viewing the suggested changes and editing the document.</li>
            <li><b>Final</b> - this mode is used to display all the changes as if they were accepted. This option does not actually accept all changes, it only allows you to see how the document will look like after you accept all the changes. In this mode, you cannot edit the document.</li>
            <li><b>Original</b> - this mode is used to display all the changes as if they were rejected. This option does not actually reject all changes, it only allows you to view the document without changes. In this mode, you cannot edit the document.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="managechanges">Accept or reject changes</h3>
        <p>Use the <img alt="To Previous Change button" src="../images/review_previous.png" /> <b>Previous</b> and the <img alt="To Next Change button" src="../images/review_next.png" /> <b>Next</b> buttons on the top toolbar to navigate through the changes.</p>
        <p>To accept the currently selected change you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>click the <img alt="Accept button" src="../images/review_accepttoptoolbar.png" /> <b>Accept</b> button on the top toolbar, or</li>
            <li>click the downward arrow below the <b>Accept</b> button and select the <b>Accept Current Change</b> option (in this case, the change will be accepted and you will proceed to the next change), or</li>
            <li>click the <b>Accept</b> <img alt="Accept button" src="../images/review_accept.png" /> button of the change pop-up window.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To quickly accept all the changes, click the downward arrow below the <img alt="Accept button" src="../images/review_accepttoptoolbar.png" /> <b>Accept</b> button and select the <b>Accept All Changes</b> option.</p>
        <p>To reject the current change you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>click the <img alt="Reject button" src="../images/review_rejecttoptoolbar.png" /> <b>Reject</b> button on the top toolbar, or</li>
            <li>click the downward arrow below the <b>Reject</b> button and select the <b>Reject Current Change</b> option (in this case, the change will be rejected and you will move on to the next available change), or</li>
            <li>click the <b>Reject</b> <img alt="Reject button" src="../images/review_reject.png" /> button of the change pop-up window.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To quickly reject all the changes, click the downward arrow below the <img alt="Reject button" src="../images/review_rejecttoptoolbar.png" /> <b>Reject</b> button and select the <b>Reject All Changes</b> option.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: if you review the document, the <b>Accept</b> and <b>Reject</b> options are not available for you. You can delete your changes using the <img alt="Delete change button" src="../images/review_delete.png" /> icon within the change balloon.</p>
