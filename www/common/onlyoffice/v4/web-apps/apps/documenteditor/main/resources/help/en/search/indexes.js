If you need to compare and merge two documents, you can use the document Compare feature. It allows displaying the differences between two documents and merge the documents by accepting the changes one by one or all at once. After comparing and merging two documents, the result will be stored on the portal as a new version of the original file. If you do not need to merge documents which are being compared, you can reject all the changes so that the original document remains unchanged.

To navigate through the sections of the Documents module, use the menu on the left part of the window. Select the necessary .docx document and click the OK button. When the second document for comparison is selected, the comparison process will start and the document will look as if it was opened in the Review mode.

Additional info on the comparison feature Method of comparison Documents are compared by words. If a word contains a change of at least one character (e.g. if a character was removed or replaced), in the result, the difference will be displayed as the change of the entire word, not the character. The image below illustrates the case when the original file contains the word 'Characters' and the document for comparison contains the word 'Character'. Authorship of the document When the comparison process is launched, the second document for comparison is being loaded and compared to the current one. If the loaded document contains some data which is not represented in the original document, the data will be marked as added by a reviewer. If the original document contains some data which is not represented in the loaded document, the data will be marked as deleted by a reviewer. If the authors of the original and loaded documents are the same person, the reviewer is the same user. His/her name is displayed in the change balloon. If the authors of two files are different users, then the author of the second file loaded for comparison is the author of the added/removed changes. Presence of the tracked changes in the compared document If the original document contains some changes made in the review mode, they will be accepted in the comparison process. When you choose the second file for comparison, you'll see the corresponding warning message. In this case, when you choose the Original display mode, the document will not contain any changes."

The Text Wrapping tab contains the following parameters: Wrapping Style - use this option to change the way the shape is positioned relative to the text: it will either be a part of the text (in case you select the inline style) or bypassed by it from all sides (if you select one of the other styles). Inline - the shape is considered to be a part of the text, like a character, so when the text moves, the shape moves as well. In this case the positioning options are inaccessible. If one of the following styles is selected, the shape can be moved independently of the text and positioned on the page exactly: Square - the text wraps the rectangular box that bounds the shape. Tight - the text wraps the actual shape edges. Through - the text wraps around the shape edges and fills in the open white space within the shape. So that the effect can appear, use the Edit Wrap Boundary option from the right-click menu. Top and bottom - the text is only above and below the shape. In front - the shape overlaps the text. Behind - the text overlaps the shape. If you select the square, tight, through, or top and bottom styles, you will be able to set up some additional parameters - distance from text at all sides (top, bottom, left, right). The Position tab is available only if the selected wrapping style is not inline.

The Gridlines section allows specifying which of the Horizontal/Vertical Gridlines you wish to display by selecting the necessary option from the drop-down list: Major, Minor, or Major and Minor. You can hide the gridlines at all using the None option. Note: the Axis Settings and Gridlines sections will be disabled for Pie charts since charts of this type have no axes and gridlines. Note: the Vertical/Horizontal Axis tabs will be disabled for Pie charts since charts of this type have no axes. The Vertical Axis tab allows you to change the parameters of the vertical axis also referred to as the values axis or y-axis which displays numeric values. Note that the vertical axis will be the category axis which displays text labels for the Bar charts, therefore in this case the Vertical Axis tab options will correspond to the ones described in the next section. For the XY (Scatter) charts, both axes are value axes. The Axis Options section allows setting the following parameters: Minimum Value - is used to specify the lowest value displayed at the vertical axis start. The Auto option is selected by default, in this case the minimum value is calculated automatically depending on the selected data range. You can select the Fixed option from the drop-down list and specify a different value in the entry field on the right. Maximum Value - is used to specify the highest value displayed at the vertical axis end. The Auto option is selected by default, in this case the maximum value is calculated automatically depending on the selected data range. You can select the Fixed option from the drop-down list and specify a different value in the entry field on the right. Axis Crosses - is used to specify a point on the vertical axis where the horizontal axis should cross it. The Auto option is selected by default, in this case the axes intersection point value is calculated automatically depending on the selected data range. You can select the Value option from the drop-down list and specify a different value in the entry field on the right, or set the axes intersection point at the Minimum/Maximum Value on the vertical axis. Display Units - is used to determine the representation of the numeric values along the vertical axis. This option can be useful if you're working with great numbers and wish the values on the axis to be displayed in a more compact and readable way (e.g. you can represent 50 000 as 50 by using the Thousands display units). Select desired units from the drop-down list: Hundreds, Thousands, 10 000, 100 000, Millions, 10 000 000, 100 000 000, Billions, Trillions, or choose the None option to return to the default units. Values in reverse order - is used to display values in the opposite direction. When the box is unchecked, the lowest value is at the bottom and the highest value is at the top of the axis. When the box is checked, the values are ordered from top to bottom. The Tick Options section allows adjusting the appearance of tick marks on the vertical scale. Major tick marks are the larger scale divisions which can have labels displaying numeric values. Minor tick marks are the scale subdivisions which are placed between the major tick marks and have no labels. Tick marks also define where gridlines can be displayed if the corresponding option is set on the Layout tab. The Major/Minor Type drop-down lists contain the following placement options: None to not display major/minor tick marks, Cross to display major/minor tick marks on both sides of the axis, In to display major/minor tick marks inside the axis, Out to display major/minor tick marks outside the axis. The Label Options section allows adjusting the appearance of major tick mark labels which display values. To specify a Label Position in regard to the vertical axis, select the necessary option from the drop-down list: None to not display tick mark labels, Low to display tick mark labels to the left of the plot area, High to display tick mark labels to the right of the plot area, Next to axis to display tick mark labels next to the axis. The Horizontal Axis tab allows you to change the parameters of the horizontal axis also referred to as the categories axis or x-axis which displays text labels. Note that the horizontal axis will be the value axis which displays numeric values for the Bar charts, therefore in this case the Horizontal Axis tab options will correspond to the ones described in the previous section. For the XY (Scatter) charts, both axes are value axes. The Axis Options section allows setting the following parameters: Axis Crosses - is used to specify a point on the horizontal axis where the vertical axis should cross it. The Auto option is selected by default, in this case the axes intersection point value is calculated automatically depending on the selected data range. You can select the Value option from the drop-down list and specify a different value in the entry field on the right, or set the axes intersection point at the Minimum/Maximum Value (that corresponds to the first and last category) on the horizontal axis. Axis Position - is used to specify where the axis text labels should be placed: On Tick Marks or Between Tick Marks. Values in reverse order - is used to display categories in the opposite direction. When the box is unchecked, categories are displayed from left to right. When the box is checked, the categories are ordered from right to left. The Tick Options section allows adjusting the appearance of tick marks on the horizontal scale. Major tick marks are the larger divisions which can have labels displaying category values. Minor tick marks are the smaller divisions which are placed between the major tick marks and have no labels. Tick marks also define where gridlines can be displayed if the corresponding option is set on the Layout tab. You can adjust the following tick mark parameters: Major/Minor Type - is used to specify the following placement options: None to not display major/minor tick marks, Cross to display major/minor tick marks on both sides of the axis, In to display major/minor tick marks inside the axis, Out to display major/minor tick marks outside the axis. Interval between Marks - is used to specify how many categories should be displayed between two adjacent tick marks. The Label Options section allows adjusting the appearance of labels which display categories. Label Position - is used to specify where the labels should be placed in regard to the horizontal axis. Select the necessary option from the drop-down list: None to not display category labels, Low to display category labels at the bottom of the plot area, High to display category labels at the top of the plot area, Next to axis to display category labels next to the axis. Axis Label Distance - is used to specify how closely the labels should be placed to the axis. You can specify the necessary value in the entry field. The more the value you set, the more the distance between the axis and labels is. Interval between Labels - is used to specify how often the labels should be displayed. The Auto option is selected by default, in this case labels are displayed for every category. You can select the Manual option from the drop-down list and specify the necessary value in the entry field on the right. For example, enter 2 to display labels for every other category etc. The Cell Snapping tab contains the following parameters: Move and size with cells - this option allows you to snap the chart to the cell behind it. If the cell moves (e.g. if you insert or delete some rows/columns), the chart will be moved together with the cell. If you increase or decrease the width or height of the cell, the chart will change its size as well. Move but don't size with cells - this option allows to snap the chart to the cell behind it preventing the chart from being resized. If the cell moves, the chart will be moved together with the cell, but if you change the cell size, the chart dimensions remain unchanged. Don't move or size with cells - this option allows to prevent the chart from being moved or resized if the cell position or size was changed. The Alternative Text tab allows specifying a Title and Description which will be read to people with vision or cognitive impairments to help them better understand what information the chart contains. Move and resize charts Once the chart is added, you can change its size and position. To change the chart size, drag small squares situated on its edges. To maintain the original proportions of the selected chart while resizing, hold down the Shift key and drag one of the corner icons. To alter the chart position, use the icon that appears after hovering your mouse cursor over the chart. Drag the chart to the necessary position without releasing the mouse button.

If the Constant Proportions button is clicked (in this case it looks like this ), the width and height will be changed together preserving the original chart aspect ratio. The Text Wrapping tab contains the following parameters: Wrapping Style - use this option to change the way the chart is positioned relative to the text: it will either be a part of the text (in case you select the inline style) or bypassed by it from all sides (if you select one of the other styles). Inline - the chart is considered to be a part of the text, like a character, so when the text moves, the chart moves as well. In this case the positioning options are inaccessible. If one of the following styles is selected, the chart can be moved independently of the text and positioned on the page exactly: Square - the text wraps the rectangular box that bounds the chart. Tight - the text wraps the actual chart edges. Through - the text wraps around the chart edges and fills in the open white space within the chart. Top and bottom - the text is only above and below the chart. In front - the chart overlaps the text. Behind - the text overlaps the chart. If you select the square, tight, through, or top and bottom styles, you will be able to set up some additional parameters - distance from text at all sides (top, bottom, left, right). The Position tab is available only if the selected wrapping style is not inline. This tab contains the following parameters that vary depending on the selected wrapping style: The Horizontal section allows you to select one of the following three chart positioning types: Alignment (left, center, right) relative to character, column, left margin, margin, page or right margin, Absolute Position measured in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified on the File -> Advanced Settings... tab) to the right of character, column, left margin, margin, page or right margin, Relative position measured in percent relative to the left margin, margin, page or right margin. The Vertical section allows you to select one of the following three chart positioning types: Alignment (top, center, bottom) relative to line, margin, bottom margin, paragraph, page or top margin, Absolute Position measured in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified on the File -> Advanced Settings... tab) below line, margin, bottom margin, paragraph, page or top margin, Relative position measured in percent relative to the margin, bottom margin, page or top margin. Move object with text ensures that the chart moves along with the text to which it is anchored. Allow overlap makes it possible for two charts to overlap if you drag them near each other on the page. The Alternative Text tab allows specifying a Title and Description which will be read to the people with vision or cognitive impairments to help them better understand what information the chart contains."
