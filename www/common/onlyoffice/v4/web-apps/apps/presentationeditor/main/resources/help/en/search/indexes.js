Alternate Input is used to turn on/off hieroglyphs. Alignment Guides is used to turn on/off alignment guides that appear when you move objects and allow you to position them on the slide precisely. Autosave is used in the online version to turn on/off automatic saving of changes you make while editing. Autorecover - is used in the desktop version to turn on/off the option that allows you to automatically recover documents if the program closes unexpectedly. Co-editing Mode is used to select a way of displaying changes made during co-editing: By default, the Fast mode is selected, the users who take part in the presentation co-editing, will see the changes in real time once they are made by other users. If you prefer not to see the changes made by other users (so that they will not disturb you, or for some other reason), select the Strict mode, and all the changes will be shown only after you click the Save icon with a notification that there are some changes made by other users. Default Zoom Value is used to set the default zoom value selecting it in the list of available options from 50% to 200%. You can also choose the Fit to Slide or Fit to Width option.

In the second cache mode, a picture of a certain size is selected where letters are placed dynamically and a mechanism of allocating/removing memory in this picture is also implemented. If there is not enough memory, a second picture is created, etc. The Default cache mode setting applies two above mentioned cache modes separately for different browsers: When the Default cache mode setting is enabled, Internet Explorer (v. 9, 10, 11) uses the second cache mode, other browsers use the first cache mode. When the Default cache mode setting is disabled, Internet Explorer (v. 9, 10, 11) uses the first cache mode, other browsers use the second cache mode. Unit of Measurement is used to specify what units are used on the rulers and in properties windows for measuring elements parameters such as width, height, spacing, margins, etc. You can select the Centimeter, Point, or Inch option. Cut, copy and paste - used to show the Paste Options button when content is pasted. Check the box to enable this feature. Macros Settings - used to set macros display with a notification.
