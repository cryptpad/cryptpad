		<h1>Supported Formats of Spreadsheets</h1>
			<p>A <b>spreadsheet</b> is a table of data organized in rows and columns. 
			It is most frequently used to store the financial information because of its ability to re-calculate the entire sheet automatically after a change to a single cell.
			<b>Spreadsheet Editor</b> allows you to open, view and edit the most popular spreadsheet file formats.</p>
