			<h1>Align your text in a paragraph</h1>
			<p>The text is commonly aligned in four ways: left, right, center or justified. To do that,</p>
			<ol>
				<li>place the cursor to the position where you want the alignment to be applied (this can be a new line or already entered text),</li>
				<li>select the alignment type you would like to apply:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Left</b> alignment with the text lined up by the left side of the page (the right side remains unaligned) is done with the <b>Align Left</b> <img alt="Align Left icon" src="../images/alignleft.png" /> icon situated at the top toolbar.</li>
						<li><b>Center</b> alignment with the text lined up by the center of the page (the right and the left sides remains unaligned) is done with the <b>Align Center</b> <img alt="Align Center icon" src="../images/aligncenter.png" /> icon situated at the top toolbar.</li>
						<li><b>Right</b> alignment with the text lined up by the right side of the page (the left side remains unaligned) is done with the <b>Align Right</b> <img alt="Align Right icon" src="../images/alignright.png" /> icon situated at the top toolbar.</li>
						<li><b>Justify</b> alignment with the text lined up by both the left and the right sides of the page (additional spacing is added where necessary to keep the alignment) is done with the <b>Justify</b> <img alt="Justify icon" src="../images/justify.png" /> icon situated at the top toolbar.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
